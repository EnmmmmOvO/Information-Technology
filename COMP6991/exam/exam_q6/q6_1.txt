1. Rust's use of `unsafe` is segmented, providing a clear demarcation to separate the unsafe parts, ensuring the rest of the code can be statically analyzed. This use of `unsafe` also serves as a caution to developers, signaling them to be aware of why `unsafe` is necessary in that context. Additionally, for auditors, it clearly indicates which parts require manual inspection. In contrast, in C and C++, unsafe memory operations can be scattered throughout all code without explicit markers, making them difficult to track and audit.

2. For Rust, its advantage lies in static analysis ensuring data safety. However, excessive use of unsafe, particularly in memory operations, can weaken Rust's security advantages. Moreover, the presence of unsafe may reduce scrutiny on other security aspects. Rust only guarantees memory safety and does not ensure other types of errors.
