Estimate sizes of join results for ...

1. select * from R, S where R.s = S.id

   (where S.id is a primary key
    and R.s is a foreign key referencing S.id)

Max size = r_R
 when no tuples in R have R.s is null

Min size = 0 
 when all tuples in R have R.s is null


2. select * from R, S where R.s <> S.id

   (where S.id is a primary key
    and R.s is a foreign key referencing S.id)

Max size ~= r_R * (r_S-1)
 when no tuples in R have R.s is null

Min size = 0
 when all tuples in R have R.s is null


3. select * from R, S where R.x = S.y

   (where R.x and S.y have no connection
    except that dom(R.x)=dom(S.y), e.g. integer)

Min size = 0
 when V(x,R) intersect V(y,S) = Empty

Max size = r_R * r_S
 when |V(x,R)| == |V(y,S)| == 1 and V(x,R) == v(y,S)
 (very unlikely)
