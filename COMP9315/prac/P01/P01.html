<h2>Aims</h2>

This exercise aims to get you to:
<ul>
<li> set up your directories on a file system
</li><li> install a PostgreSQL database server
</li></ul>
<p>
You ought to get it done by the middle of Week 2.
</p>

<p>
<b>Notation</b>:
In the examples below, we have used the <code>$</code> sign to represent
the prompt from the Unix/Linux shell. The actual prompt may
look quite different on your computer (e.g. it may contain the computer's
hostname, or your username, or the current directory name).
In the example interactions, all of the things that the computer
displays are in <code>this font</code>.
The commands that <b>you</b> are supposed to type are in
<code><b>this bold font</b></code>.
Comments in the examples are introduced by '...' and are written in
<code><span class="comment">this grey font</span></code>;
comments do not appear on the computer screen, they simply aim to explain what
is happening.
Whenever we use the word <code><var>edit</var></code>, this means that you should
use your favourite text editor (e.g. <code>vi</code>, <code>emacs</code>, <code>gedit</code>,
etc.)
Finally, some commands use <code><var>YOU</var></code> as a placeholder for your CSE username (which is usually your zid). This is the same as the <code>$USER</code> environment variable in Linux.
</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
PostgreSQL has three major components:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the source code (and the compiled <code>*.o</code> files) (approx 200MB)
</li><li> the installed executables (like <code>pg_ctl</code> and <code>psql</code>) (approx 20MB)
</li><li> the data (including configuration files and databases) (at least 35MB)
</li></ul>
<p>
You will <i>not</i> be able to fit the above components under your CSE <em>home</em>
directory (insufficient disk quota)
</p>
<p>
The practical work for the assignments can be carried out on a special CSE server called <code>vxdb</code>. You run your own PostgreSQL server on this machine and are effectively the database administrator of this server. This machine has been configured to run large numbers** of PostgreSQL servers.
</p>
<div class="note">
<p>
** Note: "large numbers" is around 300. If you leave your work to the last minute, and find 400 other students all trying to run PostgreSQL on <code>vxdb</code>, performance will be sub-optimal. Of course, you can avoid this potential bottleneck by installing and running PostgreSQL on your home machine.
</p>
</div>
<p>
You <i>must</i> put your PostgreSQL source code, installed
executables and data under the <code>/localstorage/$USER</code> directory on <code>vxdb</code>.
You must run the server process on <code>vxdb</code>; do <i>not</i>
run your PostgreSQL server process on any other CSE machines; if you do, your PostgreSQL server will most likely be terminated automatically not long after it starts.
</p>
<p>
If you're doing all of this work on a laptop
or desktop at home, then you can configure things however you like.
You will still need folders for the same three components
(source code, executables, and data),
but you can place them wherever you like.
PostgreSQL doesn't require any special privileges to run
(at least on Unix-based systems like Linux and Mac OS X),
so you do <em>not</em> need to create a special privileged
PostgreSQL user; you can run the server as yourself.
</p>
<div class="note">
Reminder: You should always test your work on <code>vxdb</code> before you submit assignments, since that's where we'll be running our tests to award your marks.
</div>

<a name="makedir"></a>
<h3>Getting started on vxdb</h3>

<div class="note">
You may have a <code>/localstorage/$USER</code> directory on <code>vxdb</code> already
(e.g. from a previous database course).
If so, you can skip this section; but you might want to clean out any <code>pgsql</code> directory before you continue.
</div>
<p>
You can log into <code>vxdb</code> from a command-line (shell) window on any CSE machine (including vlab) via the command
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">ssh nw-syd-vxdb.cse.unsw.edu.au</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
If you're doing this exercise from home, you can use any ssh client, but you'll need to refer to <code>nw-syd-vxdb.cse</code> as <code>d.cse</code>:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">ssh YourZID@d.cse.unsw.edu.au</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
You can check whether you're actually logged in to <code>vxdb</code>
by using the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">hostname</kbd>
nw-syd-vxdb
</pre>
<p>
Your home directory at CSE is directly accessible from
<code>vxdb</code>.
</p>
<p>
The first time you log in to <code>vxdb</code>, it automatically
creates a directory under <code>/localstorage</code> to hold your databases:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">ls -al /localstorage/$USER</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
This directory is initially empty, but we're about to put the
files for a PostgreSQL server into it.
</p>

<h2>Setting up your PostgreSQL Server</h2>

<p>
<b>Reminder:</b>
If you are working from CSE make sure you are <code>ssh</code>'d on into <code>vxdb</code>.
The times below are approximate; they could double or triple depending
on your environment.
</p>

<h3>Installation Details (for non-experts):</h3>

<h4>Setting up directories</h4>
<p>
The first step is to make sure that the directory <code>/localstorage/$USER</code>
exists. You can check this via the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">ls -l /localstorage/$USER</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
If the above command says something like "No such file or directory", then
you should create it using the instructions <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/#makedir">above</a>.
</p><p>
Once you have a directory on the <code>/localstorage</code> filesystem, the next step
is to place a copy of the PostgreSQL source code under this directory.
The following commands will do this:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">cd /localstorage/$USER</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">tar xfj /web/cs9315/24T1/postgresql/postgresql-15.6.tar.bz2</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
This creates a subdirectory called <code>postgresql-15.6</code> under your
<code>/localstorage/$USER</code> directory and unpacks all of the source code there.
This produces no output and will take a few moments to complete.
If you want to watch as <code>tar</code> unpacks the files, use
<code>xvfj</code> instead of <code>xfj</code> as the first argument to
<code>tar</code>.
</p>

<h4>Initial compilation</h4>
<p>
Once you've unpacked the source code, you should change into the
newly created <code>postgresql-15.6</code> directory and configure
the system so that it uses the directory <code>/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</code>
to hold the executables for your PostgreSQL server.
(Note that <code>/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</code> does not exist yet;
it will be created in the <code>make install</code> step).
The following commands will do the source code configuration:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">cd /localstorage/$USER/postgresql-15.6</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./configure --prefix=/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The <code>configure</code> command will print lots of messages about
<code>checking</code> for various libraries/modules/etc.
This process will take a minute, and should produce no errors.
</p>
<p>
After configuring the source code,
the next step is to build all of the programs.
Stay in the <code>postgresql-15.6</code> directory
and then run the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">make</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
This compiles <em>all</em> of the PostgreSQL source code,
and takes around 4-5 minutes (depending on the load on vxdb).
It will produce <em>lots</em> of output,
but should compile everything OK.
If anything goes wrong, the <tt>make</tt> process will stop
partway through with an obvious error message.
</p>

<h4>Installing executables</h4>
<p>
Once the PostgreSQL programs are compiled, you need to install them.
The following command does this:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">make install</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
This creates the directory <code>/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</code>,
and copies all of the executables
(such as <code>pg_ctl</code> and <code>psql</code>) under that directory.
It will take a minute to do this,
and will produce quite a bit of output while it's doing it.

</p><h4>Data directories</h4>
<p>
You're not finished yet, however, since PostgreSQL has no directory
in which to store all of its data. You will install the data directories under <code>/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</code>
</p><p>
Before doing anything with the database, however,
you need to ensure that your Unix environment is set up correctly.
We have written a small script called <code>env</code> that will do this.
In this set up stage, you should copy this script to your <code>/localstorage</code>
directory:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">cp  /web/cs9315/24T1/postgresql/env  /localstorage/$USER/env</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The <code>env</code> script contains the following:
</p>
<pre>export PGDATA=/localstorage/$USER/pgsql/data
export PGHOST=$PGDATA
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/localstorage/$USER/pgsql/lib

export PATH=/localstorage/$USER/pgsql/bin:$PATH

alias p0="pg_ctl stop"
alias p1="pg_ctl -l $PGDATA/log start"
</pre>
<p>
This script sets up a number of environment variables.
The critical ones are:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt><code>PGDATA</code></dt>
<dd>which tells the PostgreSQL server where it's data directories are located</dd>
<dt><code>PGHOST</code></dt>
<dd>which tells PostgreSQL clients where are the socket files to connect to the server</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Note that in the discussion below, we will use the string <code><var>YOUR_PGDATA</var></code>
to refer to that value that you assigned to <code>PGDATA</code> in your <code>env</code>
file and which has been set by <code>source</code>'ing the <code>env</code> file  in your shell.
</p>

<h4>Initialising data directories and running server</h4>
<p>
Once you have a copy of the <code>env</code> script and have set the values
appropriately,
you need to invoke it in every shell window where you plan to interact
with the database.
You can do this by explicitly running the following command in each
window:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">source /localstorage/$USER/env</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
If that gets tedious, you might consider adding the above command
to your shell's startup script (e.g., <code>~/.bash_profile</code>).
</p>
<p>
Once you've set up the environment, check that it's ok via the following
commands:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">echo $PGDATA</kbd>
<var>YOUR_PGDATA</var> <span class="comment">... i.e. whatever value you set it to ...</span>
<kbd is="shell">which initdb</kbd>
/localstorage/<var>YOU</var>/pgsql/bin/initdb
<kbd is="shell">which pg_ctl</kbd>
/localstorage/<var>YOU</var>/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl
</pre>
<p>
If the system gives you different path names to the above,
then your environment is not yet set up properly.
Are you sure that you <code>source</code>'d your <code>env</code> file?
</p>
<p>
If all of the above went as expected,
you are now ready to create the
data directories and run the server.
You can do this via the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">initdb</kbd>
<span class="comment">... some output eventually finishing with something like ...</span>
Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D <var>YOUR_PGDATA</var> -l logfile start
</pre>
<p>
If you look at your data directory now, you should see something like:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">ls $PGDATA</kbd>
PG_VERSION    pg_hba.conf    pg_replslot   pg_subtrans	postgresql.auto.conf
base	      pg_ident.conf  pg_serial	   pg_tblspc	postgresql.conf
global	      pg_logical     pg_snapshots  pg_twophase	postmaster.opts
pg_commit_ts  pg_multixact   pg_stat	   pg_wal
pg_dynshmem   pg_notify      pg_stat_tmp   pg_xact
</pre>
<p>
You shouldn't start the server straight away, however, since there's one
more bit of configuration needed.
You need to edit the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file in the <code>$PGDATA</code>
directory and change the values of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> change the value of the <code>listen_addresses</code> parameter to <b><code>''</code></b>:
     this means that only Unix-domain sockets
     can be used to connect to the server
     (saving you fighting over TCP ports);
</li><li> reduce the value of <code>max_connections</code> from 100 to <b>10</b>:
     this reduces the resources tied up by the server
     to support those connections potentially occurring; and
</li><li> set the value of the <code>unix_socket_directories</code> parameter to the full path of your <b><code>$PGDATA</code></b> directory; make sure to input the literal path instead of using <code>$USER</code> (e.g. <code>/localstorage/z5555555/pgsql/data</code>):
     this specifies where PostgreSQL keeps its connection sockets,
     and should be the same as your <code>$PGDATA</code>
     so <code>psql</code> and other clients can connect; and
</li><li> set the value of <code>max_wal_senders</code> to e.g. 4 (or
	 any value less than whatever value you use for <code>max_connections</code>)
</li></ul>
<p>
Once you're done, the "connections and authentications"
part of your modified <code>postgresql.conf</code> file
should look like (with the changes highlighted in red):
</p>
<pre>#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONNECTIONS AND AUTHENTICATION
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# - Connection Settings -

<span class="red">listen_addresses = ''</span>                   # what IP address(es) to listen on;
                                        # comma-separated list of addresses;
                                        # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all
                                        # (change requires restart)
#port = 5432                            # (change requires restart)
<span class="red">max_connections = 10</span>                    # (change requires restart)
#superuser_reserved_connections = 3     # (change requires restart)
<span class="red">unix_socket_directories = '<var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>'</span> # comma-separated list of directories
                                        # (change requires restart)
#unix_socket_group = ''                 # (change requires restart)
#unix_socket_permissions = 0777         # begin with 0 to use octal notation
                                        # (change requires restart)
....
<span class="red">max_wal_senders = 4</span>
</pre>
<p>
Note that it doesn't matter
that the file says <code>port = 5432</code>:
this value will be overridden
by whatever you set your
<code>PGPORT</code> environment variable to.
</p>
<p>
Note also that the 5432 also doesn't matter
because the <code>#</code> at the start of the line
means that it's a comment.
In the case of the lines that you are supposed to change,
<strong>make sure that you remove the <code>#</code>
from the start of those lines</strong>.
</p><p>
Everything is now ready to start your PostgreSQL server,
which you can do via the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">pg_ctl start -l $PGDATA/log</kbd>
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p>
You may have noticed that we provided you with shorthand to
start and stop the server in the <code>env</code> file.
The command <code>p1</code> starts the server and <code>p0</code>
stops it.
</p>
</div>
<p>
Note that PostgreSQL says "server starting",
whereas it should probably say "attempting to start server".
</p>
<p>
A quick way to check whether the server is working is to run the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">psql -l</kbd><span style="font-size:90%">
SET
                            List of databases
   Name    | Owner | Encoding | Collate |    Ctype    | Access privi
leges 
-----------+-------+----------+---------+-------------+-------------
------
 postgres  | <var>YOU</var>   | UTF8     | C       | en_AU.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | <var>YOU</var>   | UTF8     | C       | en_AU.UTF-8 | =c/<var>YOU</var>      
     +
           |       |          |         |             | <var>YOU</var>=CTc/<var>YOU</var>
 template1 | <var>YOU</var>   | UTF8     | C       | en_AU.UTF-8 | =c/<var>YOU</var>      
     +
           |       |          |         |             | <var>YOU</var>=CTc/<var>YOU</var>
(3 rows)
</span></pre>
<p>
It is possible that the server may not start
correctly. If the server does not appear to have started,
you can check why by looking at the tail of the server log:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">tail -20 $PGDATA/log</kbd>
<span class="comment">... information about what happened at server start-time ...</span>
</pre>
<p>
Note that you'll get error messages about not being able to run the
statistics collector, and a warning that autovacuum was not started.
These are not an issue at this stage.
</p>
<p>
If the server is running correctly,
the <code>psql -l</code> will give you a list of databases like the above.
If the server is not running, you'll get a message something like:
</p>
<pre>psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "<var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</pre>
<p>
If this happens, you should check the log file to find out what went wrong.
(Other things to check in case of problems are described <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/#debugging">below</a>).
</p>
<p>
Assuming that the server is running ok, you can now use it to create and
manipulate databases (see the example below).
Once you've finished your session using PostgreSQL, you need to stop the
server.
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">pg_ctl stop</kbd>
waiting for server to shut down.... done
</pre>
<p>
If you still have a process that's using the database (e.g. a <code>psql</code>
process in another window), then the server won't be able to shut down.
You'll need to quit all of the processes that are accessing the database
before the above command will work.
</p>

<h4>A Typical session with PostgreSQL</h4>
<p>
Once you've got your PostgreSQL server installed, this is what you'd
normally do to use it.:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">source /localstorage/$USER/env</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">p1</kbd>
<span class="comment">... hopefully concluding with the message ...</span>
server started
<kbd is="shell">psql -l</kbd>
<span class="comment">... hopefully giving a list of databases ...</span>
<kbd is="shell">createdb myNewDB</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">psql myNewDB</kbd>
<span class="comment">... do stuff with your database ... </span>
<kbd is="shell">p0</kbd>
<span class="comment">... hopefully concluding with the message ...</span>
server stopped
</pre>

<p>
Note that the data will persist across sessions.
If you <i>really</i> want to clean out you whole server, you
can use the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">rm -fr /localstorage/$USER/pgsql</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
This is the "nuclear option". Only use it as a last resort.
You will need to rbuild the server from the <code>initdb</code> step.
</p>

<h3>Reminder</h3>

<p>
You <em>must</em> shut down your server at the end of each
session with PostgreSQL if you're working on the CSE workstations.
Failure to do this means that the next student who uses that
workstation may need to adjust their configuration (after first
working out what the problem is) in order
to start their server.
</p>

<h2>A Sample Database</h2>

<p>
Once your server is up-and-running, you ought to load up the small
sample database (on beers) and try a few queries on its data.
This is especially important if you haven't used PostgreSQL before;
you need to get used to its interactive interface.
</p>
<p>
You can set up the beer database as follows:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">createdb beer</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">psql beer -f <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/beer.dump">/web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/beer.dump</a></kbd>
<span class="comment">... around 20 lines include SET, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE...</span>
<kbd is="shell">psql beer</kbd>
SET
psql (15.6)
Type "help" for help.

<kbd is="psql" db="beer">select count(*) from beers;</kbd>
 count
-------
    24
(1 row)

<kbd is="psql" db="beer">\d</kbd>
<span class="comment">... gives a list of tables in the database ...</span>
<kbd is="psql" db="beer"></kbd>
<span class="comment">... explore/manipulate the database ...</span>
<kbd is="psql" db="beer">\q</kbd>
<kbd is="shell"></kbd>

<p>
For exploring the database with <code>psql</code>, there are a
collection of <code>\d</code> commands. You can find out more about
these via <code>psql</code>'s <code>\?</code> command or by reading
the PostgreSQL manual <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12//app-psql.html">chapter on <code>psql</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
To help with your explorations of the database, here is an
diagram of the schema.
Table/relation names are in bold; each box represents one
attribute; primary keys are underlined.
Note that all primary keys are symbolic (not numeric) in
this database.
You can look at the SQL schema from within <code>psql</code>.

<h2>Sorting out Problems</h2>

<p>
It is very difficult to diagnose problems with software over email,
unless you give sufficient details about the problem.
An email that's as vague as <q>My PostgreSQL server isn't
working. What should I do?</q>, is basically useless.
Any email about problems with software should contain details of
</p>
<ul>
<li> what you were attempting to do
</li><li> precisely what commands you used
</li><li> precisely what output you got
</li></ul>
<p>
One way to achieve this is to copy-and-paste the last few commands
and responses into your email.
</p>
<p>
But even with all of that information, there's a whole host of other
environment information that's needed to be able to seriously work out
why your server isn't running, that you can't put in an email.
That's why it's better to come to a consultation, where we can work
through the problem on a workstation (which is usually very quick).

<h4>Can't start server?</h4>
<p>
When you use <code>p1</code> to try to start your PostgreSQL server,
you observe something like:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">p1</kbd>
waiting for server to start.................................................pg_ctl: could not start server
Examine the log output.
Check whether the server started ok via the command 'psql -l'.
If it's not working, check /localstorage/$USER/pgsql/log for details.
</pre>
<p>
Take the advice given to you by the command and look at the end of the log
file to see if there are any clues there. You can do this via the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">tail -20 $PGDATA/log</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes you may need to look at more than the last 20 lines of the log
file to find the relevant error message.
Most of the error messages are self-explanatory, and you should learn what
to do if any of them occurs.
Some examples:
</p>
<pre>FATAL:  lock file "postmaster.pid" already exists
HINT:  Is another postmaster (PID 31265) running in data directory "<var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>"?
<span class="comment">
# You may already have another PostgreSQL server running
# Or, the previous server may have quit without cleaning up the postmaster.pid file
# Note that the server process may be running on another machine if you run your
#  server on the local machine rather than vxdb
# If the server is running on another machine, log in there and run "p0"
</span>
LOG:  could not bind IPv4 socket: Address already in use
HINT:  Is another postmaster already running on port 5432? If not, wait a few seconds and retry.
WARNING:  could not create listen socket for "localhost"
FATAL:  could not create any TCP/IP sockets
<span class="comment">
# Another user is running a PostgreSQL server on this machine
# Change the PGPORT value in /localstorage/$USER/env
#  and then reset your environment and try starting the server again
</span>
FATAL:  could not open relation mapping file "global/pg_filenode.map": No such file or directory
FATAL:  could not open relation mapping file "global/pg_filenode.map": No such file or directory
FATAL:  could not open relation mapping file "global/pg_filenode.map": No such file or directory
FATAL:  could not open relation mapping file "global/pg_filenode.map": No such file or directory
<span class="comment">
# This means that there is another PostgreSQL server of yours still running
# You'll need to find it e.g. using the command "ps auxw"
# Note that the process could be running on any CSE machine where you ever
#  ran a PostgreSQL server, so you may need to check on multiple machines
# Once you've found it, stop the server using the Unix kill command
# and then reset your environment and try starting the server again
</span>

<p>
Sometimes the <code>pg_ctl</code> command will give a message that the server
has failed to start but you'll get no error messages at the end of the log
file, which will look something like:
</p>
<pre>LOG:  database system was shut down at 2011-08-03 11:38:26 EST
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
</pre>
<p>
One cause of this is having different directories for <code>PGHOST</code> in
the <code>/localstorage/$USER/env</code> file and for <code>unix_socket_directory</code>
in the <code><var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/postgresql.conf</code> file. It is critical that
these two both refer to the same directory. You can check this by running
the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">psql -l</kbd>
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/localstorage/$USER/pgsql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
</pre>
<p>
You should then check the <code><var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/postgresql.conf</code> file to
see whether <code>unix_socket_directories</code> has been set to
<code>/localstorage/$USER/pgsql</code>.
Note that the directory name may not be exactly the same as this; the critical
thing is that the directory be the same in both places.
</p>

<h4>Can't shut server down?</h4>
<p>
When you use <code>p0</code> to try to shut down your PostgreSQL server,
you observe something like:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">p0</kbd>
waiting for server to shut down........................
</pre>
<p>
and no <code>done</code> ever appears.
</p>
<p>
This is typically because you have an <code>psql</code>
session running in some other window (the PostgreSQL server won't shut
down until all clients have disconnected from the server).
The way to fix this is to find the <code>psql</code> session and end it.
If you can find the window where it's running, simply use <code>\q</code>
to quit from <code>psql</code>.
If you can't find the window, or it's running from a different machine
(e.g. you're in the lab and find that you left a <code>psql</code> running
at home), then use <code>ps</code> to find the process id of the
<code>psql</code> session and stop it using the Linux <code>kill</code>
command.
</p>

<h4>Can't restart server?</h4>
<p>
Occasionally, you'll find that
your PostgreSQL server was not shut down cleanly the last time you
used it and you cannot re-start it next time you try to use it.
The symptoms are:
</p>
<pre>Using PostgreSQL with data directory <var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>
pg_ctl: another server might be running; trying to start server anyway
pg_ctl: could not start server
Examine the log output.
Check whether the server started ok via the command 'psql -l'.
If it's not working, check /localstorage/$USER/pgsql/log for details.
</pre>
<p>
If you actually go and check the log file, you'll probably find,
right at the end, something like:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">tail -2 /localstorage/$USER/pgsql/log</kbd>
FATAL:  lock file "postmaster.pid" already exists
HINT:  Is another postmaster (PID <var>NNNN</var>) running in data directory "<var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>"?
</pre>
<p>
where <code><var>NNNN</var></code> is a process number.
</p>
<p>
There are two possible causes for this: the server is already running
or the server did not terminate properly after the last time you used it.
You can check whether the server is currently running by the command
<code>psql -l</code>. If that gives you a list of your databases, then
you simply forgot to shut the server down last time you used it and it's
ready for you to use again. If <code>psql -l</code> tells you that
there's no server running, then you'll need to do some cleaning up
before you can restart the server ...
</p>
<p>
When the PostgreSQL server is run, it keeps a record of the Unix process
that it's running as in a file called:
</p>
<pre><var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/postmaster.pid
</pre>
<p>
Normally when your PostgreSQL server process terminates (e.g. via
<code>p0</code>), this file will be removed. If your PostgreSQL
server stops, and this file persists, then <code>p1</code> becomes
confused and thinks that there is still a PostgreSQL server running
even though there isn't.
</p>
The first step in cleaning up is to remove this file:
<pre><kbd is="shell">rm <var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/postmaster.pid</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
You should also clean up the socket files used by the PostgreSQL
server. You can do this via the command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">rm <var>YOUR_PGDATA</var>/.s.PGSQL.*</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
Once you've cleaned all of this up, then the <code>p1</code>
command ought to allow you to start your PostgreSQL server ok.
