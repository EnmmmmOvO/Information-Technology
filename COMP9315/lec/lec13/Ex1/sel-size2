r = 500,   V(X,R) = 5,  a,b,c,d,e,NULL ~ 40:20:10:10:10:10

Estimate cost for ...

1. select * from R where X is not null

90% are not null = 450 tuples


2. select * from R where X >= 'c'

30% satisfy condition => 150 tuples


3. select * from R where X between 'b' and 'd'

40% satisfy condition => 200 tuples
