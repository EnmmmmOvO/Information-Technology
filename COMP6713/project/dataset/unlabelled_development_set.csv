<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Regional Local Health Networks moved to a Consumer Directed Care model for the provision of aged care, disability, and support services. This allows consumers to maintain greater control over their lives by allowing them to make choices about the services they receive and who delivers those services. Consumers are encouraged to actively participate in identifying and setting goals, and to determine what level of involvement they want in managing their own care arrangements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Under this model of care, the funding associated with the role of the Community Support Worker is controlled by consumers, rather than by the health provider. This means that consumers have an active role in determining the shifts that are available, the duties that are performed, the frequency of demand for the service, and the choice of provider organisation.</p>
<p>The Community Support Worker is integral to supporting this model of care by providing services including personal care, cleaning, meal preparation, transport and social support, to persons who are aged, frail or disabled and who wish to remain living in their own home with some assistance, or are living in a Residential Aged Care facility.</p>
<p>Community Support Workers need to be flexible, conscientious and empathetic and be able to work autonomously in the community. They will work closely and collaboratively with the consumer, their family and other health professionals, to provide quality outcomes and maintain consumer independence where possible.</p>
<p>Riverland Mallee Coorong Local Health Network Inc supports staff to further develop their skills across a variety of areas. Ongoing education is encouraged and enables staff to provide quality and responsive services to consumers.</p>
<p>Working at&nbsp;<strong>WHA4&nbsp;</strong>level you must have a certificate 3 in Individual Support (Ageing, Disability or Home and Community).&nbsp; Working at&nbsp;<strong>WHA5&nbsp;</strong>level you must have a certificate 3&nbsp;in Individual Support (Ageing, Disability or Home and Community) and at least 560 hours satisfactory in service experience.</p>

Strategy Director (Creative)</p>
<p>Job Description:
About Us
We are Dentsu Creative.
We believe brands aren’t built like they used to be, and audiences aren’t either. Three forces are driving this change.
First, most CMOs and CEOs want to acquire more customers with less investment. Second, great brand ads don’t create a great brand experience. Finally, too much of the money being spent by marketers is easily ignored as attention is harder to grasp than ever.
We believe you can’t grow a brand if people don’t notice what you create. People don’t see the expected. People don’t see the predictable. The familiar is too often forgotten. Which is why we create The Never Before.
The Never Before is the most elusive of ideas. The one you never saw coming, but you will never forget. The kind that turns the expected on its head. The Never Before doesn’t have a template. There are no guidelines. It will make you nervous, good nervous. But if it gets made, it will make everyone else jealous. Yes, people will have ‘concerns’. But that’s how you know you’re close. Because work like this has never been done before.
About You
Above all, you love it when clients say, “Why haven’t we thought of that before?” after presenting your thinking.
You want to be a very senior strategic brain across key accounts in the Dentsu Creative Singapore business.
You want to lead the brand and communications strategy for Dentsu Creative clients, in partnership with the client and creative leads.
You are knowledgeable in brand management and can apply the proven principles of growth to any category.
You are strong at brand diagnostics and turning the findings into effective strategy and tactics.
You can help architect long-term business and brand strategies for large clients.
You are focused on unearthing and articulating ‘never-before’ insights to inspire world-class creative work.
You generate excitement around an array of creative opportunities and champion creativity in the client organization.
You know how to champion a brand’s purpose/positioning and ensure that it lives across all key touchpoints and communications.
You don’t just make briefs; you shape them and can proactively identify new opportunities for great creative work.
You can mentor junior members of the team with clarity and consistency, helping others to grow and develop.
You champion a culture of effectiveness, ensuring every dollar spent generates a return.
You can command a room, craft a compelling story, sell it, and form long-lasting relationships.

As a Product Manager, you have been given the challenge of making this process less painful for everyone involved. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to understand the target customer base, their needs, and challenges, and come up with expected solutions.

English Teacher,"""Our mission is to provide an inclusive, international education in a safe, happy, supportive and stimulating environment where all the needs of the individual learner are met. Students are inspired to be the best they can be, enabling them to become responsible global citizens.""_

<br /><br />**English Teacher**

<br /><br />English is taught to all students throughout the High School, with Key Stage 3 schemes of work broadly based on the National Curriculum, adapted to reflect both our location in South East Asia and the international nature of our students, and leading to both English Language and Literature IGCSEs in Years 10 and 11. We aim, as far as possible, to include even students with significant EAL needs in this, though schemes of work for some groups may be adapted and some of these students may also take IGCSE English as a Second Language in Year 11.

<br /><br />In Key Stage 5, all students must study two languages as part of the IB Diploma Programme, with most students taking either English Literature or Language and Literature at Higher or Standard Level, though some students study their First language and English Language B at Higher or Standard Level.

<br /><br />At St Andrews, we pride ourselves on being an inclusive school, and have an excellent reputation for supporting children with special educational needs. Experience of teaching children with dyslexia, mild autism, ADHD etc. would be very good prior experience for a teacher wishing to join our team. Our Mission Statement commits us to meeting ‘all the needs of the individual learner’, and this applies equally to those students targeting the very highest grades at both IGCSE and IB.

<br /><br />All English classrooms have data projectors and there is a strong commitment to integrating the teaching and use of ICT skills into all areas of the curriculum.

<br /><br />St Andrews is committed to ensuring the safety of all our students, and expects all staff to share the same commitment (see our Child Protection Code of Conduct). No teacher will be appointed without at least two references, including one from the most recent employer, a ten year criminal record check and relevant regional Prohibition Order/DBS checks.
