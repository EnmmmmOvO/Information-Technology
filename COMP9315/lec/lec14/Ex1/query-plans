1. select max(birthday) from People

sequential scan, with aggregate checking max


2. select max(id) from People

id is a pk => have Btree index
backward scan index to find right-most key


3. select family from People order by family

sort, invoked by sequential scan of People



4. select distinct p.id, p.name 
   from   People p, Course_Enrolments e 
   where  p.id=e.student and e.grade='FL'

nested loop join
  outer relation is Sel[e.grade='FL']
  inner relation is People

5. select * from EnrolmentCounts where code='COMP9315';

Tmp1 = select code=COMP9315 from Subjects
Tmp2 = Join Courses [c.subject=Tmp1.id] Tmp1
Tmp3 = Join Tmp2 [Tmp2.semester=s.id] Semesters
Tmp4 = Join Tmp3 [Tmp3.c.id = e.course] Enrolments
Tmp5 = Sort Tmp4 by t.year,t.term
Tmp6 = Group code,year,term Tmp5
Res  = Aggregate e.student on Tmp6
