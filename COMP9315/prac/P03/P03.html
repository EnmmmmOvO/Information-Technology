<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>This simple exercise aims to get you to:</p>
<ul>
<li> examine the configuration of your PostgreSQL servers </li>
<li> start to understand the filesystem layout of PostgreSQL files </li>
<li> start to understand the internal structure of PostgreSQL data files </li>
</ul>
<p>You ought to do it before the end of week 3.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL has a wide range of configuration parameters which
are described in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/runtime-config.html">Chapter 19</a>
of the PostgreSQL documentation.
For the purposes of this lab, we are most interested in the
configuration parameters related to resource usage
(described in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/runtime-config-resource.html">Section 19.4</a>).
</p>
<p>
Most configuration parameters can be set by modifying the
<code><var>$PGDATA</var>/postgresql.conf</code> file and restarting the server.
Many configuration parameters can also be set via command-line
arguments to the <code>postgres</code> server when it is initially
invoked.
Note that you <em>cannot</em> set parameters if you invoke the server
via the <code>pgs</code> script; <code>pgs</code> aims to simplify
things by allowing few options and starting the server with the
configuration specified in <code>postgresql.conf</code>.
The standard PostgreSQL mechanism for starting the server is yet
another script, called <code>pg_ctl</code> (see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pg-ctl.html"><code>pg_ctl</code></a>
section of the PostgreSQL documentation).
The simplest way to invoke <code>pg_ctl</code> is one of:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">pg_ctl start</kbd>
server starting
<kbd is="shell">pg_ctl stop</kbd>
waiting for server to shut down.... done
server stopped
<kbd is="shell">pg_ctl status</kbd>
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: <var>nnnnnn</var>)
/localstorage/<var>z5555555</var>/pgsql/bin/postgres
</pre>
<p>
The <code>pgs</code> script simply invokes <code>pg_ctl</code> to
start a server, with some extra options:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">pg_ctl -w start -l /localstorage/$USER/pgsql/data/log</kbd>
waiting for server to start...... done
server started
</pre>
<p>
The <code>-l</code> option tells the PostgreSQL server which file to use
to write its log messages.
The log file is important, not only because it is where PostgreSQL
writes error messages so that you can work out e.g. why your server
wouldn't start, but also because it is where PostgreSQL writes
statistical information about its performance (if requested).
</p>
<p>
The <code>-w</code> option tells <code>pg_ctl</code> to wait until the server
has actually started properly before returning. If the server does not
start properly, you will eventually receive a message like:
</p>
<pre>pg_ctl: could not start server
Examine the log output.
</pre>
<p>
If the server fails to start, you should check your environment
and the server setup (e.g. <code>$PGDATA/postgresql.conf</code>).
Note that there are two aspects to consider for the environment:
the contents of <code>/localstorage/$USER/env</code> <em>and</em>
the settings of the shell variables in your current window;
the two should be consistent.
A trouble-shooting guide for setting up your server appears at the bottom of
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/index.php#debugging">Prac Exercise P01</a>.
</p>
<p>
The primary function of the <code>pg_ctl</code> command is to invoke
the <code>postgres</code> server.
It can perform additional functions such as specifying the location
of the log file (as we saw above)
or passing configuration parameters to the server.
To pass configuration parameters, you use the <code>-o</code> option
and a single string containing all the server parameters.
For example, the <code>-B</code> parameter to <code>postgres</code>
lets you say how many shared memory buffers the server should use,
and you could start <code>postgres</code> and get it to use just 16
buffers as follows:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">pg_ctl start -o '-B 16' -l /localstorage/$USER/pgsql/log</kbd>
server starting
</pre>
<p>
As a warm-up exercise, work out how many shared buffers the PostgreSQL
server uses by default. (Hint: this is given in the
<code>postgresql.conf</code> file in units of MB (not number of
buffers); each buffer is 8KB long).
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q1a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q1&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q1" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
The value in the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file produced by
<code>pgs</code> is the default 128MB.
If the value of <code>shared_buffers</code> in <var>N</var>MB,
and the size of each buffer is 8KB,
then the total number of buffers is given by
the formula (<var>N</var>*1024*1024)/8192.
For 128MB, this gives 16384 buffers.
</p>
</div><p></p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
Start your PostgreSQL server as normal (i.e. don't change any
configuration parameters) before getting started with the exercises.
</p>

<h4>Ex0: Load a new Test Database</h4>
<p>
Under the COMP9315 Pracs directory you'll find a new testing
database. Create a new database to hold it, and load it up.
There are two representations of the database available:
</p>
<ul>
<li> as a PostgreSQL dump file
</li><li> as a pair of SQL files, one containing the schema and the other the data
</li></ul>
<p>
The dump file is quicker to load, but not as "user-friendly" (i.e. not
as readable) as the SQL files.
</p>
<p>You create the database in the usual way:</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">createdb uni</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
I called the database <code>uni</code> because it contains (fake)
data about a University. You can find out the database schema from
the
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/schema.sql"><code>schema.sql</code></a>
file.
</p>
<p>
To load the database, use the following commands:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">psql uni -f /web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/db.dump &gt; load.out 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">grep ERR load.out</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The first command loads the dump file and ensures that all output is
written to a file called <code>load.out</code>.
The second command checks for any error messages produced during the
load.
If there are any errors, you should <em>not</em> ignore them,
but instead try to work out what the problem is and fix it.
</p>

<h4>Ex1: Devise some Queries on the Test DB</h4>
<p>
The first thing to do with any database is to ensure that you understand
what data is in it. Use <code>psql</code> (or some GUI tool, if you're
using one) to explore the database. I've added a function that will give
you counts of the number of tuples in each table:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="psql" db="uni">select * from pop();</kbd>
    table    | ntuples
-------------+---------
 assessments |   14098
 courses     |     980
 enrolments  |    3506
 items       |    3931
 people      |    1980
(5 rows)
</pre>
<p>
You can look at the definition of the <code>pop()</code> (short for
"population") either in the
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/pop.sql"><code>pop.sql</code></a>
file, or via <code>psql</code>'s <code>\df+</code> command.
</p>
<p>
If you're using <code>\df+</code>, you'll find it useful to change how
<code>psql</code> displays its results, otherwise the output from
<code>\df+</code> is a mess. You can switch the output format in
<code>psql</code> using the <code>\x</code> command. This causes
<code>psql</code> to show the value of each attribute on a seperate
line; useful if attributes values are large.
Don't forget to use <code>\x</code> to change the output format
back before continuing.
</p>
<p>
Once you think you're familiar enough with the database, devise SQL
queries to answer the following:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> what is the largest staff/student id? (<code>People.id</code>)
<p><small>[<a id="q2a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q2&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>

<p>
For the first four queries above, think about and describe the patterns of access
to the data in the tables that would be required to answer them.
</p><p><small>[<a id="q8a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q8&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q8" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<ol type="a">
<li> <p>Requires all <code>People.id</code> values to be accessed; potentially
	this would need a scan over all tuples in the relation, hence all pages
	would need to be read. However, there's an index on the <code>People.id</code>
	attribute (PostgreSQL makes a B-tree index on all primary keys) which
	contains all of the <code>People.id</code> values. In theory, the system
	could determine the largest value simply by looking at the index.
    How could we work out whether it was doing a full table scan or simply
    reading the index?</p>
</li><li> <p>Requires all <code>People.birthday</code> values to be accessed. Since
	there is no index on birthdays, this will definitely require PostgreSQL
	to read all of the tuples/pages in the <code>People</code> table.</p>
</li><li> <p>Requires all <code>Items.maxmark</code> values to be accessed;
	since this is not a key attribute and there are no indexes on it,
	all tuples/pages from the <code>Items</code> table will need to be read.</p>
</li><li> <p>Requires a join on the <code>Courses</code> and <code>Items</code>
	table; each tuple in each table will need to be accessed, possibly
	multiple times; in the worst-case scenario, we would read the
	<code>Courses</code> table once and read the entire <code>Items</code>
	table for each page in the <code>Courses</code> table.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
You can compare the time taken for the first two queries by turning on
<code>psql</code>'s timing mechanism, using the command <code>\timing&nbsp;on</code>.
If you run the first two queries a few times you will observe that (a) the time
value is different each time (thanks to the way times are computed),
(b) that the first query generally takes less time thatn the second.
</p>
</div><p></p>
<h4>Ex2: Explore the Files of the Test DB</h4>
<p>
Now that you've used the database, let's take a look at how the data
is stored in the file system.
All data is for a given database is stored under the directory (folder):
</p>
<pre>$PGDATA/base/<var>OID</var>
</pre>
<p>
where <code>$PGDATA</code> is the location of the PostgreSQL data directory
as set in your <code>env</code> file, and the <code><var>OID</var></code> is the unique
internal id of the database from the <code>pg_database</code> table.
Work out, using the PostgreSQL catalog, which directory corresponds to
your newly-created database.
(Hint: the <code>pg_database</code> table will help here. Also,
<code>psql</code>'s <code>\dS</code> command will tell you the
names of all catalog tables).
</p><p><small>[<a id="q9a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q9&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q9" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
The following SQL query will help you work out what is the
<code><var>OID</var></code> for your database:
</p>
<pre>select oid, datname from pg_database
</pre>
<p>
This will give you a list of databases, including <code>template1</code>,
<code>template0</code> and <code>postgres</code>, each with an associated
OID.
There should also be a tuple for your <code>uni</code> database; the OID
value should also appear as the name of a directory in <code>pgsql/data/base/</code>.
</p>
</div><p></p>
<p>
Change into the relevant directory and run the <code>ls</code> command.
This will show dozens of files. Most of these files contain local
data from system catalog tables, while others contain your <code>uni</code>
data.
Recall from lectures that data files associated with a table are
named after the <code><var>OID</var></code> of that table.
Use the PostgreSQL catalog to work out which files
correspond to your tables.
</p><p><small>[<a id="q10a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q10&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q10" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
The following SQL query will do it:
</p>
<pre>select c.oid,c.relname
from   pg_class c, pg_namespace n
where  c.relkind='r' and c.relnamespace=n.oid and n.nspname='public';
</pre>
<p>
If you omit the last condition in the query, you'll get all of the
system tables as well, which will help you work out what all of the
other files in the directory are.
</p>
</div><p></p>
<p>
All of the data files in this directory are in binary format, so you can't
read them with a text editor or the standard Unix file pagers (like <code>more</code>
and <code>less</code>). Sometimes, however, you can get <var>some</var> information from a
binary file via the <code>strings</code> command, which prints any text-strings
that it finds in the file. Try this on the file corresponding to the <code>Courses</code>
table and you should get a list of course codes and course titles, with a few
"junk" characters. Since this generates a lot of output, you might want to
use something like the following command:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">strings <var>OID_of_Courses_data_file</var> | less</kbd>
BENV2254;Theories of Colour and Light
BENV2228?C20 Arch:Modernity-Deconstruc.

<span class="comment">etc. etc. etc.</span>
</pre>
<p>
Note that you won't necessarily see <em>exactly</em> the output shown above.
The order that tuples are inserted into a page depends on many factors that
vary from system to system.
What you are guaranteed to see are some strings containing data relevant to
courses.
</p>
<p>
An alternative way to examine binary data files is via the Unix <code>od</code>
command (read the <code>man</code> entry if you don't know what it does).
Examine the files corresponding to the <code>People</code> table
and the <code>Assessments</code> table
to see if you can observe the data they contain
and also to see if you can work out
how the data is laid out within the pages of the file.
You can can get assistance with
understanding the intra-page data layout
from the source code files:
</p>
<pre>/localstorage/$USER/postgresql-16.1/src/include/storage/bufpage.h
/localstorage/$USER/postgresql-16.1/src/backend/storage/page/bufpage.c
</pre>
<p>
You'll probably notice some other files with similar <code><var>OID</var></code>s
to the data files, and other files with the same <code><var>OID</var></code>s
but with added suffixes. Suggest what might be contained in these
files. (Searching for suffixes in the source code might help for those
files with suffixes).
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q11a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p03/##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q11&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q11" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
The files with <code>_fsm</code> suffixes contain free space maps which
indicate where space is available in the data file (see
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/storage-fsm.html">Section 68.3</a>
of the PostgreSQL documentation).
</p>
<p>
The files with <code>_vm</code> suffixes contain visibility maps which
indicate pages that contain tuples visible to all active transactions;
this allows vacuuming to be optimised (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/storage-vm.html">Section 68.4</a>
of the PostgreSQL documentation).
</p>
<p>
The files with OIDs close to those of the table data files, but without
any free space maps are index files (each table has an index on its
defined primary key).
</p>
</div><p></p>
<p>
While you're examining the data files, return to <code>psql</code> and
write a query to print the number of data pages in each relation.
This is a simple modification of the query above to get the table OIDs.
