Optimising binary search in sorted file

Approach #1

- store min,max values for each *bucket* in data page
- avoids need to traverse overflow list if key not in bucket
- disadvantage: may need to write data + overflow if insert
  new tuple into overflow page

Approach #2

- store list of (pid,min,max) values in header page
- would allow us to find relevant bucket with 1 page read
- only then would we need to read data+overflow pages
