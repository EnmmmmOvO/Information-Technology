The solar industry is experiencing significant growth, with energy prices on the rise and solar panel costs decreasing considerably, leading to an oversupply in the market. National subsidies are further fuelling this growth, making solar installations more attractive than ever.<br />As a result, the typical payback period for solar investments has shortened to just 2-3 years.&nbsp;<br />Many businesses are taking advantage of this opportunity by selling excess energy back to the grid through Power Purchasing Agreements (PPAs). These agreements allow them to enjoy electricity cost savings of 30-40% while ensuring that their solar systems are fully maintained and monitored for the duration of their contracts, which can span anywhere from 10 to 30 years.</p>",AUS,$225000 - $250000.00 Salaried plus Commission,225000-250000-AUD-ANNUAL

<b>Company</b><p>Pada awal tahun 1951, mesyuarat pertama diadakan yang dipengerusikan oleh Encik M. Pakianathan, Penolong Akauntan Lembaga Letrik Pusat telah bersetuju untuk menubuhkan sebuah Koperasi khusus bagi kakitangan Lembaga Letrik Pusat yang bergaji bulanan</p>
<p>Penubuhan Koperasi ini telah dipersetujui oleh Encik F.G. Egerton, Pengurus Besar Lembaga Letrik Negara pada masa tersebut.</p>
<p>Permohonan pendaftaran telah dibuat di Pendaftar Pertubuhan Koperasi pada 1hb Ogos 1951.</p>
<p>Maka rasmilah pendaftaran Syarikat Kerjasama Jimat Cermat dan Pinjaman Wang Lembaga Letrik Pusat Sendirian Berhad dengan nombor pendaftaran 261/51-1449.</p>
<p>Pada Jun 1965, Koperasi telah menukar nama kepada Syarikat Kerjasama Jimat Cermat dan Pinjaman Wang Lembaga Letrik Negara Sendirian Berhad, dimana perubahan ini adalah sejajar dengan pertukaran nama Lembaga Letrik Pusat kepada Lembaga Letrik Negara.</p>
<p>Objektif utama Koperasi adalah menggalakkan aktiviti jimat cermat serta menjalankan fungsi-fungsi pinjaman, pengguna, perkhidmatan dan perumahan.</p>
<p>Memandangkan sebutan nama ini yang agak panjang, pada tahun 1967, Koperasi telah menukar namanya kepada Koperatif Lembaga Letrik Berhad.</p>
<p>Pada September 1990, selaras dengan dasar penswastaan Negara yang turut melibatkan Lembaga Letrik Negara ditransformasikan dari sebuah Lembaga kepada Syarikat Korporat bernama Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Koperasi juga telah mengambil langkah yang sewajarnya untuk menukar nama kepada Koperasi Tenaga Nasional Berhad sehingga kini.</p>",MY,,1500-2345-MYR-MONTHLY

We've been operating for 5 years and have been experiencing substantial growth across all our service offerings, and we are keen to continue the momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people haven't worked in a small business growing that fast. One day you'll arrive at work, and three processes have changed overnight. That's how fast we change to keep up with 80-100% YoY growth. You need to be prepared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Watchful.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Watchful. is a subsidiary of Crosbies Security Limited.

That's what ChatGPT wrote! Really, we stop bad guys from slowing down building sites across Auckland, and we do the best job of anyone in our market by a long stretch.</p><p>We continually work hard to achieve the best security outcomes for our clients. That's also what ChatGPT wrote. But what it didn't write were our values. Those were written by our team. They are:</p><p>• <strong>Determined</strong> - Don't show up unless you're going to actually give a damn to solve the tough challenges you'll face.</p><p>• <strong>Committed to whanaungatanga</strong> - Care about your clients (they pay your wages, really), and of course, your peers.</p><p>• <strong>Lateral thinker</strong> - In-the-box solutions will kill our business so if this is you, please, scroll on!</p><p>• <strong>Positive team player</strong> - Help out your buds to see them succeed and do it silently when no one is watching.</p><p>• <strong>Ground-breaker</strong> - Think of ideas to shape the future of the business.</p><p>• <strong>High standards</strong> - If you know what we mean when we say, “dress one standard higher than the audience you're addressing,” then you'll have no trouble with this one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p>We can't teach attitude or cultural fit.

So what will you do day in, day out?</p><p>As part of our Customer Service Monitoring Team, you&nbsp;will be literally stopping bad guys (kind of like how they do it in the movies) by doing the following:</p><p>You will need to make quick, methodical decisions like how Neo had to choose between the red and the blue pill in the Matrix&nbsp;– Monitoring over 5000 camera activations a month and coordinating with your fellow Customer Experience Officers to deliver on our values and brand promises.</p><p>You will need to have an eye for detail and think of yourself as Sherlock Holmes – Liaising with the Police and other emergency services to provide evidence, information, and real-time updates on what and where the bad guys are so you can help the good guys.</p><p>You will possess the ability to be an excellent communicator and with that great power, comes great responsibilities – Coordinate with internal stakeholders (sales and service team) to make sure we are kept up-to-date on&nbsp;what is happening to our overnight operations. You will play an integral part in shaping the improvement of our customer experience, everyday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does ""good"" look like?</strong></p><p>KPIs are a thing in our business, but for good reason: they set you and us up for a successful working relationship. You will be measured on the following key KPIs:</p><p>• Response times to camera activations<br />• Job open-to-closure rates<br />• Number of tickets logged<br />• Customer NPS: Apple's NPS is 72. Ours is 67. We don't have far to go! So yeah, this is a critical measure for your customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Benefits and Perks:</strong></p><p>• We are offering a base of $24 - $26 per hour for the right candidate, with a review after six months of being employed with Crosbies Security.<br />• Shift work with the opportunity to pick up more shifts.<br />• Free life insurance benefit ($300k or 4x salary, whichever is lower) after three months of employment.<br />• Free private healthcare insurance benefit ($1,000 excess) including pre-existing conditions covered, through NIB, after three months of employment.<br />• Leadership development program available for those who wish to progress their career.
