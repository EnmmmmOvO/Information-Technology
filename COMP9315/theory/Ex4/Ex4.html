<br><li>
<p>
You have an unsorted heap file containing 4500 records and
a select query is asked that requires the file to be sorted.
The DBMS uses an external merge-sort that makes efficient
use of the available buffer space.
</p>
<p>
Assume that: records are 48-bytes long (including a 4-byte sort
key); the page size is 512-bytes; each page has 12 bytes of
control information in it; 4 buffer pages are available.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
How many sorted subfiles will there be after the initial pass
of the sort algorithm? How long will each subfile be?
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q1a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex04/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q1&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q1" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
We need to first of all work out the blocking factor and then the
number of data blocks. The available space for storing records in each
page is 512-12=500 bytes, so each page can store up to 10 48-byte records.
This means that 450 pages are needed to store the 4500 records.
</p>
<p>
In the first pass, we read as many pages as we can into the available
buffers, sort these page in memory, and then write them out.
Given that 4 buffer pages are available, there will be ceil(450/4)=113
sorted runs (sub-files) of 4 pages each, except the last run which is only
2 pages long.
</p>
</div><p></p>
</li><li>
<p>
How many passes (including the initial pass considered above)
will be required to sort this file?
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q2a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex04/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q2&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q2" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
After pass 0, we have N=ceil(b/B) sorted runs, each of length B.
Subsequent merging passes will increase the length of the sorted runs
by B-1 times on each pass.
The number of merging passes until the whole file is sorted is
ceil(log<sub>B-1</sub>N).
</p><p>
</p><p>
For this scenario, b=450, B=4, N=113 so #passes = 1 + ceil(log<sub>4-1</sub>113) = 6.
</p>

<p>
What will be the total I/O cost for sorting this file?

<div id="q3" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
Each pass requires us to read and write every page in the file.
The total number of I/O operations is thus 2*b*#passes.
The total cost for sorting this file is 2 * 450 * 6 = 5,400 I/Os.
</p>
</div><p></p>
</li><li>
<p>
What is the largest file, in terms of the number of records,
that you can sort with just 4 buffer pages in 2 passes?
How would your answer change if you had 257 buffer pages?
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q4a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex04/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q4&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q4" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
We first need to work out the answer in terms of number of pages
(b), and then convert to number of records.
</p>
<p>
In pass 0, ceil(b/B) runs are produced. In pass 1, we must have enough
buffers to enable us to merge this many runs, so B-1 must be larger or
equal to ceil(b/B). Given B, we can determine b by "solving"
(B-1) â‰¥ ceil(b/B). Re-arranging the formula (with a few simplifying
assumptions) gives b = B*(B-1).
</p>
<p>
When B is given to be 4, b = 4*(4-1) = 12. The maximum number
of records on 12 pages is 12*10=120.
</p>
<p>
When B is given as 257, b= 257*256 = 65792, with 65792*10=657920 records.

Show the flow of records among the pages (buffers and files)
when a hash-based implementation of projection is used
to eliminate duplicates in this relation.
</p><p>
Assume that:
</p><ul>
<li> each page (data file page or in-memory buffer) can hold 1000 records
</li><li> the partitioning phase uses 1 input buffer, 3 output buffers and
	the hash function <code>(x mod 3)</code>
</li><li> the duplicate elimination phase uses 1 input buffer, 4 output buffers
	and the hash function <code>(x mod 4)</code>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><small>[<a id="q8a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex04/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q8&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q8" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
In the partition phase, there are 3 partitions produced (because of
the mod 3 hash function). The first contains records with <tt>course</tt>
from the set 0,3,6,9; the second contains records with <tt>course</tt>
from 1,4,7; the third partition contains records with <tt>course</tt> 2,5,8.
</p><p>The following diagram shows the partitioning phase:
</p>
<center>
<img src="./Ex4_files/phase1.png">
</center>
<p>
From the record counts, we can compute that the first partition contains
5,000+3,000+1,000+1,000 = 10,000 records. Given that that there are 1000
records per page, this makes 10 pages. The second partition contains
4,000+2,000+1,000 records, giving 7 pages. The third partition contains
5,000+1,000+2,000 records, giving 8 pages.
</p>
<p>
In the elimination phase, there are three stages, one to deal with each
of the partitions.
</p>
<p>
In the first stage, we read back all of the 0,3,6,9 records and apply
the mod 4 hash function. The first record with key=0 goes into buffer 0,
and all other key=0 records are eliminated when they see the first one.
The first record with key=3 goes into buffer 3, and all other key=3 records
are eliminated when they see the first one. The first record with key=6
goes into buffer 2, and all other key=6 records are eliminated when they
see the first one. The first record with key=9 goes into buffer 1, and
all other key=9 records are eliminated when they see the first one. At
the end of this stage, we can scan through the buffers and extract four
distinct output records.
</p>
<p>
The following diagram shows the elimination phase for this first partition:
</p>
<center>
<img src="./Ex4_files/phase2.png">
</center>
<p>
The second stage proceeds similarly, with key=1 records hashing to buffer
1, key=4 records hashing to buffer 0 and key=7 records hashing to buffer
3. Buffer 2 is unused.
</p>
<p>
The third stage proceeds similarly, with key=2 records hashing to buffer
2, key=5 records hashing to buffer 1 and key=8 records hashing to buffer
0. Buffer 3 is unused.

Consider processing the following SQL projection query:
</p>
<pre>select distinct title,name from Staff;
</pre>
<p>
You are given the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the relation <tt>Staff</tt> has attributes
<tt>id</tt>, <tt>name</tt>, <tt>title</tt>, <tt>dept</tt>, <tt>address</tt>
</li><li>
except for <tt>id</tt>, all are string fields of the same length
</li><li>
the <tt>id</tt> attribute is the primary key
</li><li>
the relation contains 10,000 pages
</li><li>
there are 10 records per page
</li><li>
there are 10 memory buffer pages available for sorting
</li></ul>
<p>
Consider an optimised version of the sorting-based projection algorithm:
The initial sorting pass reads the input and creates sorted runs of tuples
containing only the attributes <tt>name</tt> and <tt>title</tt>.
Subsequent merging passes eliminate duplicates while merging the initial
runs to obtain a single sorted result (as opposed to doing a separate
pass to eliminate duplicates from a sorted result).
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
How many sorted runs are produced on the first pass?  What is the average
length of these runs?

<div id="q9" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
In the first pass, two things happen: the two relevant fields are
projected out of each record, and the resulting records are sorted in groups
and written to an output file. Since all fields are the same size, extracting
two fields gives records that are half as big as the original records.
This means that the result file will have half as many pages as the original
file (i.e. 5,000 pages). Since there are B=10 memory buffers, these 5,000
pages can be sorted into groups of 10-pages each. The first pass thus produces
N=ceil(b/B)=500 runs of 10 pages each.
</p>
</div><p></p>
</li><li>
<p>
How many additional passes will be required to compute the final result
of the projection query? What is the I/O cost of these additional passes?
</p>

<div id="q10" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
After the first pass produces sorted groups of 10-pages in length,
the remaining passes sort the file and then do a scan to remove duplicates.
The number of passes for the sorting is ceil(log<sub>B-1</sub>N)=3, and
on each of these passes the complete file (5,000 pages) is read and written
(i.e. 2*5000=10,000 page I/Os). Since duplicates can be easily eliminated
in the final merging phase of the sort, we do not require an additional
duplicate-elimination pass (as described in the lecture notes).
Thus, the process requires a total of 3*2*5000=30,000 I/Os.

Suppose that a clustered B+ tree index on <tt>title</tt> is available.
Is this index likely to offer a cheaper alternative to sorting?
Would your answer change if the index were unclustered?

<div id="q11" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
With a clustered B+ tree index, on <tt>title</tt>, we know that
the file is (almost) sorted on <tt>title</tt> already. However, this won't
help us much since there will be many occurrences of a given title value
(e.g. Dr. Mr. Ms.) and the names associated with that title may be spread
over many pages and completely unsorted. If the index were unclustered,
we would get absolutely no help at all from it.

<div id="q12" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
Having a clustered index on <tt>name</tt> means that the file is sorted
by name, and thus multiple occurrences of a name are likely to occur in
the same data block (or, at worst, adjacent data blocks). A scan of the
B+ tree would allow us to establish this and complete the projection with
just one pass over the data file. If the index were unclustered, we would
get no help from it.

<p>
Using a clustered B+ tree index on <tt>(name,title)</tt> would also
be more cost-effective than sorting. In this case, even an unclustered
B+ tree would be helpful, because we could use an index-only scan to extract
the required information from the (already sorted how we want) index file.
