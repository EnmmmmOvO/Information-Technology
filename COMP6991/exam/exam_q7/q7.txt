Firstly, I believe Rust is an excellent programming language. Its static analysis greatly facilitates the avoidance of memory errors that programmers might otherwise encounter. The unsafe keyword distinguishes it from languages like Java and Python, which manage memory at runtime, allowing Rust to target embedded systems and facilitate hardware and low-level architectural interoperability. Through static analysis, Rust achieves garbage collection that otherwise requires runtime support in languages like Java and Python. As a low-level language, it provides relative memory safety that C and C++ do not achieve. Similar to the reasons Java became popular in internet companies years ago, although there are more restrictions, for large companies with substantial projects, this significantly reduces the likelihood of errors. Rust's superior memory management allows developers to focus more on business logic rather than extensive null checks typical in C. Consequently, both Windows and Linux are inclined or have already begun to adopt Rust as one of the underlying implementation languages.

However, Rust has a steep learning curve. It requires learners to have a background in computer systems and other popular programming languages to understand borrowing rules and the implications of references. For novice programmers, learning C may align better with their understanding of memory and the stack, where safe Rust might not sufficiently illustrate these aspects. As a relatively new language, Rust's libraries do not have the long-term support and updates that other languages' libraries do. Many features that have been long updated in other language libraries might need innovation in Rust, and stability cannot always be guaranteed. Therefore, for convenience, stability, and ease of use, many programmers and startups in fields like front-end development, artificial intelligence, and databases might opt for more established languages that have been thoroughly vetted over time. Rust may not be the best choice for them.
