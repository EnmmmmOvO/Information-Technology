<h2>Background for Questions 1-3</h2>
<p>
The programming questions involve the manipulation of a data file
type that I will call the "no-frills" file structure.
Unlike the data files in Assignment 2, there is only a single data
file; no info file, no overflow file.
</p>
<h4>Data File</h4>
<p>
A "no-frills" data file consists of a sequence of one or more pages;
each page is <tt>PAGESIZE</tt> bytes long.
All pages, except the last page, will be full (or almost full) of
tuple data; the last page must contain one or more tuples.
Even if the last page is not full of tuples, it will be <tt>PAGESIZE</tt>
bytes long.
Unused space in any page will be filled with <tt>'\0'</tt>.
There should never be a page with zero tuples, except in the case of a
file with a single page which is allowed to contain <tt>PAGESIZE</tt>
bytes, all of which are <tt>'\0'</tt>.
</p>
<div align="center">

<p>
A completely empty file (zero bytes) is <em>not</em> a "no-frills"
file.
A file whose size is not a multiple of <tt>PAGESIZE</tt> bytes is
<em>not</em> a "no-frills" file.
</p>
<h4>Pages</h4>
<p>
Each page in the file has a single-byte "header" which simply
contains a count of how many tuples are in the page.
</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>
Tuples are added to a page buffer sequentially, and are simply appended
after any existing tuples in the page buffer.
When a page buffer does not have enough room to hold the next tuple,
the current page is written at the end of the file.
The page buffer is then cleared and is ready to receive more tuples.
</p>
<h4>Tuples</h4>
<p>
Tuples in "no-frills" files, are like the tuples in the data file
in Assignment 2: a sequence of ascii characters, where
attribute values are separated by a comma (<tt>','</tt>), and the
tuple is terminated by a nul-character (<tt>'\0'</tt>).
The last tuple in each page is terminated by two nul-characters
The first of these is its own nul terminator; the second of these
indicates the end of tuple data.
</p>
<p>
Tuples contain at most <tt>MAXTUPLEN</tt> bytes, including the
commas and the terminating <tt>'\0'</tt>.
Tuples can have 2-5 attributes, and each attribute value is a
sequence of 2-10 alphabetic characters.
</p>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>
Note that the data files, while consisting primarily of ascii
characters, are still binary files.
Examining them with <tt>cat</tt>, <tt>less</tt> or a text editor
will not be helpful.
The <tt>od</tt> command shows them in a usable format (i.e. text).
You can use the <tt>od</tt> command as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>od -c data/Data1</b>
0000000  024   o   a   t   a   v   t   d   v   ,   z   d   l   j   ,   g
0000020    n   u   m   g   o   ,   u   z   s   w  \0   c   u   w   c   k
0000040    x   y   m   u   ,   q   r   x   r   v   k   a   u   ,   n   q
0000060    f   u   g   t   o   ,   l   n   k   v   r   g   s   u   q   p
0000100   \0   j   n   u   d   m   n   y   ,   n   u   o   b   n   t  \0
<i>... plus many more lines of output ...</i>
</pre>
<p>
If you want to compare two "no-frills" data files, you can use
the <tt>diff</tt> command, but this only tells you whether the
files are identical or not, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>diff DataA DataB</b>
Binary files Data1 and Data2 differ
$ <b>diff DataA DataA</b>
</pre>
<p>
No output means that the files are identical.
</p>
<p>
If you want more human-understandable output of the differences,
you could try something like:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>od -c DataX &gt; x</b>
$ <b>od -c DataY &gt; y</b>
$ <b>diff x y</b>
</pre>
<p>
This may, or may not, give you some useful insight into the
differences.
