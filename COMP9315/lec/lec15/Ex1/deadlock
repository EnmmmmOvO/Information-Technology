T1:  R(A)        W(C)                                W(D)
T2:        R(B)                          W(C)
T3:                    R(D)        W(B)
T4:                          R(E)              W(A)

All locks are granted until w3(B). Now, T3 has to wait for T2,
which has a shared lock on B, and the waits-for graph is

     T3 ----> T2

At the next step, T2 must wait for T1, which has a lock on C.
The waits-for graph is:

     T3 ----> T2 ----> T1

Next, w4(A) causes T4 to wait for T1. There is still no cycle,
and the waits-for graph is:

     T3 ----> T2 ----> T1 <---- T4

Finally, T1 tries to write D. It cannot get the exclusive lock on D
that it needs, because T3 holds a shared lock on D. If we allowed T1
to wait, the graph would be:

     T3 ----> T2 ----> T1 <---- T4
      ^                 |
      |_________________|

Thus, T1 must abort and relinquish its locks. At that time,
T2 and T4 can each get the locks they need.
When T2 finishes, T3 can proceed.
