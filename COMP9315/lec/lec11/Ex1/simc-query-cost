Consider a SIMC-indexed database with the following properties
* all pages are B = 8192 bytes
* tuple descriptors have m = 64 bits ( = 8 bytes)
* total records r = 102,400,   records/page c = 100
* false match probability pF = 1/1000
* answer set has 1000 tuples from 100 pages
* 90% of false matches occur on data pages with true match
* 10% of false matches are distributed 1 per page
Calculate the total number of pages read in answering the query.


Number of data pages:

b = ceil(r/c) = ceil(102400/100) = 1024


Number of pages of signature data:

signatures/page =
c_D = floor(B/bytes(m)) = floor(8192/8) = 1024

total signature pages =
b_D = ceil(r/c_D) = ceil(102400/1024) = 100


Number of data pages read:

true match pages = b_q = 100

false match records =
r_F = (r-r_q) * p_F = (102400 - 1000) * 0.001 = (approx) 100

90 false matches occur as part of b_q
10 false matches occur one-per-page, so b_F = 10


Total pages read:

#pages
= signature pages + true match pages + false match pages
= 100 + 100 + 10
= 210


cf. MAH with 5 unknown bits => 2^5 + 100 + Overflow-pages
