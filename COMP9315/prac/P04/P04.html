<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>
This exercise aims to get you to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> explore the mechanisms provided by PostgreSQL for adding user-defined types
</li><li> add a domain, an enumerated type, and a new base type
</li></ul>
<p>
You ought to get it done before the end of week 3.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
One thing that PostgreSQL does better than many other DBMSs, is to provide
well-defined and relatively easy-to-use mechanisms for adding new data types.
PostgreSQL's view of data types is the standard abstract data type view;
a type is a domain of <em>values</em> and a collection of <em>operators</em>
on those values.
In addition, the existence of an ordering on the values of a data type
and operations that use the ordering allow indexes to be built on attributes
of that type.
PostgreSQL has several distinct kinds of types:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>base types</dt>
 <dd>
  defined via C functions,
  and providing genuine new data types;
  built-in types such as <code>integer</code>,
  <code>date</code> and <code>varchar(<var>n</var>)</code> are base types;
  users can also define new base types;
 </dd>
<br>
<dt>domains</dt>
 <dd>
  data types based on
  a constrained version of an existing data type;
 </dd>
<br>
<dt>enumerated types</dt>
 <dd>
  defined by enumerating the values of the type;
  values are specified as a list of strings,
  and an ordering is defined on the values
  based on the order they appear in the list;
 </dd>
<br>
<dt>composite types</dt>
 <dd>
  these are essentially <em>tuple types</em>;
  a composite type is composed of a collection of named fields,
  where the fields can have different types;
  a composite type is created implicitly whenever a table is defined,
  but composite types can also be defined without the need for a table;
 </dd>
<br>
<dt>polymorphic types</dt>
 <dd>
  define <em>classes</em> of types (e.g. <code>anyarray</code>),
  and are used primarily in the definition of polymorphic functions;
 </dd>
<br>
<dt>pseudo-types</dt>
 <dd>
  special types (such as <code>trigger</code>)
  used internally by the system;
  polymorphic types are also considered to be pseudo-types.

<p>
In this exercise, we'll look at domains, enumerated types and base types.
Assignment 1, which this exercise leads into, is concerned only with base
types.
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
Re-start your PostgreSQL server on <code>vxdb</code>
(reminder: <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p01/index.php">Prac Exercise 01</a>
and don't forget to <code>source</code> the <code>env</code> file).
Create an empty database called <code>p04</code>.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
In the first exercise, we will create a <em>domain</em> and an
<em>enumerated type</em> for a similar purpose, and examine the
differences. In the second exercise we will look at the process
of creating a new <em>base type</em>.
</p>

<h3>Exercise #1</h3>
<p>
Consider the problem of defining a data type for the days of the
week. We will generally want to represent the days by their names, e.g.
</p>
<pre>Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  Sunday
</pre>
<p>
We also normally want some kind of ordering to indicate the order in
which days occur, although it is an open question (application specific)
which day starts the week. Let's assume that, as above, we start with
<code>Monday</code> and we will use the above ordering of day names.
</p>
<p>
Create the following domains and tables in your <code>p04</code>
database.
</p>
<p>
The day names are best represented in SQL as strings, so we need a
new type that can be represented by a set of strings. There are two
ways to produce a type like this in PostgreSQL:
</p>
<pre>create domain Days1 as varchar(9)
       check (value in ('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday',
                        'Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'));

create type Days2 as enum
       ('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday',
        'Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday');
</pre>
<p>
Now define a pair of tables that are identical, except that one
uses the domain and the other uses the enumerated type:
</p>
<pre>create table Log1 ( name text, day Days1, starting time, ending time );
create table Log2 ( name text, day Days2, starting time, ending time );
</pre>
<p>
Populate the tables via the following two commands:
</p>
<pre>copy Log1 (name, day, starting, ending) from '/web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p04/LogData';
copy Log2 (name, day, starting, ending) from '/web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p04/LogData';
</pre>
<p>
Examine the contents of the tables via <code>select</code> statements and
then run the following two commands:
</p>
<pre>select * from Log1 where name='John' order by day;
select * from Log2 where name='John' order by day;
</pre>
<p>
Explain why they are different.
Comment on which kind of data type definition is more appropriate
in this context.
</p>

<h3>Exercise #2</h3>
<p>
In order to define a new base data type, a user needs to provide:
</p>
<ul>
<li> input and output functions (in C) for values of the type
</li><li> C data structure definitions to represent type values internally
</li><li> an SQL definition for the type, giving its length, alignment and i/o functions
</li><li> SQL definitions for operators on the type
</li><li> C functions to implement the operators
</li></ul>
<p>
The methods for defining the various aspects of a new base type are
given in the following sections of the PostgreSQL manual:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xtypes.html">37.13 User-defined Types</a>
</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xfunc-c.html">37.10 C-Language Functions</a>
</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/xoper.html">37.14 User-defined Operators</a>
</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createtype.html">SQL: CREATE TYPE</a>
</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createoperator.html">SQL: CREATE OPERATOR</a>
</li><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-createopclass.html">SQL: CREATE OPERATOR CLASS</a>
</li></ul>
<p>
Section 37.13 uses an example of a complex number type, and you would
be well advised to at least take a quick look at it before proceeding.
This example is available in the directory <code>/localstorage/$USER/postgresql-15.6/src/tutorial</code>.
You should change into that directory now.
You will find two files relevant to the definition of the complex number
type: <code>complex.c</code> and <code>complex.source</code>.
The <code>complex.source</code> file is actually a template that will be
converted to an SQL file when you run <code>make</code> in the
<code>tutorial</code> directory.
Run the <code>make</code> command now.
The output should look something like ...
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">cd /localstorage/$USER/postgresql-15.6/src/tutorial</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">make</kbd>
rm -f advanced.sql; \
	C=`pwd`; \
	sed -e "s:_OBJWD_:$C:g" &lt; advanced.source &gt; advanced.sql
rm -f basics.sql; \
	C=`pwd`; \
	sed -e "s:_OBJWD_:$C:g" &lt; basics.source &gt; basics.sql
<span class="red">rm -f complex.sql; \
	C=`pwd`; \
	sed -e "s:_OBJWD_:$C:g" &lt; complex.source &gt; complex.sql</span>
rm -f funcs.sql; \
	C=`pwd`; \
	sed -e "s:_OBJWD_:$C:g" &lt; funcs.source &gt; funcs.sql
rm -f syscat.sql; \
	C=`pwd`; \
	sed -e "s:_OBJWD_:$C:g" &lt; syscat.source &gt; syscat.sql
<span class="red">gcc -O2 -Wall <span class="comment">...lots of compiler options...</span> -c -o complex.o complex.c
gcc -O2 -Wall <span class="comment">...lots of compiler options...</span> -o complex.so complex.o</span>
gcc -O2 -Wall <span class="comment">...lots of compiler options...</span> -c -o funcs.o funcs.c
gcc -O2 -Wall <span class="comment">...lots of compiler options...</span> -o funcs.so funcs.o
</pre>
<p>
If <code>make</code> produces errors ... are you logged in to <code>vxdb</code>?
... have you set your environment (<code>source /localstorage/$USER/env</code>)?
</p>
<p>
The relevant lines above are the ones that mention <code>complex</code> (in red).
Make sure that you read and understand exactly what is being done here.
The first red command creates the <code>complex.sql</code> file from
the <code>complex.source</code> file by filling in the appropriate directory
name so that PostgreSQL knows where to find the libraries.
The second and third red commands create a library file called
<code>complex.so</code> containing all the C functions which implement
the low-level operations on the <code>Complex</code> data type.
</p>
<p>
Once you have made the complex number library, and
while still in the <code>src/tutorial</code>
directory, start a <code>psql</code> session on a
<code>test</code> database
and run the <code>complex.sql</code> file as follows:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">createdb test</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">psql test</kbd>
psql (15.6)
Type "help" for help.

<kbd is="psql" db="test">\i complex.sql</kbd>

<kbd is="psql" db="test"></kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The <code>complex.sql</code> file sets up the <code>Complex</code> type,
creates a table that uses the type and then runs some operations
to check that it's working.
After the testing, it removes the <code>Complex</code> type.
If you want this type to remain in the <code>test</code> database, then
you should edit <code>complex.sql</code> file and remove the following
lines at the end of the file (or simply comment them out).
</p>
<pre>DROP TABLE test_complex;
DROP TYPE complex CASCADE;
</pre>
<p>
and then re-enter the <code>test</code> database and re-run the
<code>complex.sql</code> script. This will leave you with a
database containing a <code>Complex</code> number type and
table containing values of that type.
You can explore the various operations on the type.
Note that you can also create other databases and use the new
<code>Complex</code> number type in them.
The <code>Complex</code> type is now included in your PostgreSQL
server in much the same way as built-in types like <code>date</code>,
<code>integer</code> and <code>text</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once you have a feel for how the <code>Complex</code> type behaves
from the SQL level, it's time to take a look at the code that
implements it.
Read the files <code>complex.sql</code> and <code>complex.c</code> in
conjunction with the PostgreSQL manual sections mentioned above.
Once you feel confident that you understand how it all fits
together, perhaps you could try making some changes to the
<code>Complex</code> type (e.g. use <code>[...]</code> rather than
<code>(...)</code> to enclose values of type <code>complex</code>)
and installing them.
</p>
<p>
If you do plan to change the type (or implement a new type),
I would suggest making copies of the original <code>complex.c</code>
and <code>complex.source</code> (e.g. to <code>mytype.c</code> and
<code>mytype.source</code>), and then editing <code>mytype.c</code>
and <code>mytype.source</code>. You will also need to add lines
to the <code>Makefile</code> to create <code>mytype.sql</code> and
<code>mytype.so</code>.
Once you've modified the code, do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> re-run the <code>make</code> command to create <code>mytype.sql</code> and <code>mytype.so</code>
</li><li> create a new database (or simply use the <code>test</code> database)
</li><li> if the new type is called <code>Complex</code>, you'll need to drop the old <code>Complex</code> type first
</li><li> load up the new data type via <code>\i mytype.sql</code> <br>
</li><li> experiment with values of the new type
</li></ul>
