Bentleigh Secondary College is a co-educational secondary school of choice.

Bentleigh Secondary College has a core belief in promoting leadership at all levels. The College is internationally recognised for innovation through sustainability.

College Vision

We strive to make a difference by recognising that young people need strategies to help them successfully deal with an ever-changing world. Our purpose is to prepare all students to be active and engaged global citizens.

College Values

We embrace a progressive culture that champions student innovation, leadership and creative thinking through student engagement and socially inclusive activities. Open communication and respect for positive change are always encouraged. The school community works together to challenge its members to exceed expectations for achievement in all areas. This is reflected in our core values:

Excellence – being the best you can be.
Responsibility – the right to learn.
Respect – the right to be treated with respect.
Inclusiveness – the right to feel safe.
Engagement and Progress

The College uses data from the student voice and feedback to personalise the educational experience of each student, thus creating positive change in the lives of students, staff and those in the community. Our students consistently achieve excellent academic results, and the majority of graduates successfully enrol in tertiary studies.

We believe that quality teaching is the main driver of successful student learning outcomes. We have well-established, rigorous review processes. Our staff are regularly recognised for excellence in their fields of work and study. It is a core aim to provide our staff with leadership opportunities.

The College is committed to providing stimulating and engaging learning. This commitment is articulated through a whole-school focus on the explicit instructional model. Students are encouraged to progress at their own rate, exploring their interests to develop their knowledge, skills and understanding. Students are provided with high-quality feedback and are encouraged to reflect on their learning progress.

In the Wider Community

On a broader scale, we share our vision of a sustainable future and our belief in the importance of mindfulness meditation and the science of positive psychology with other learning institutions, community groups and industry. Our school and staff continue to win various awards, including the Prime Minister’s Environmentalist of the Year 2011, the Premier’s Sustainability Award in the Education category 2013 and finalist in the Victorian Outstanding Curriculum Innovation Award 2014.

Student Opportunities

Student leadership is promoted at all levels through the following activities and leadership programs: Student Representative Council; School for Student Leadership; Green Machine; Respect Committee; Drama, Music and Visual Arts programs; camps; debating; chess; debutante ball; and various sports and outdoor education programs.

Our students have the opportunity to forge global connections through our Sister School agreement with Yamada Senior High School in Osaka, Japan, which results in regular student exchange visits; our student sponsorship program with Letsibogo Girls High in Soweto, South Africa; and our International Students program.

History and Facilities

Bentleigh Secondary College was opened in 1956 and is a vibrant single-site campus with a current enrolment of more than 900 students. Our campus is located on 6.5 hectares in Bentleigh East, close to public transport. The College is organised into two sub-schools: junior (Years 7 to 9) and senior (Years 10 to 12). Each sub-school has an Assistant Principal and a Head of School.

College facilities include: a double basketball stadium; a gymnasium; an administration and hospitality wing; a Performing Arts Centre for music, drama and dance with a theatre of 250 seats; a Learning Centre incorporating open-plan spaces, four science laboratories, three multimedia spaces, a library and five flexible classrooms. We are soon to undertake redevelopment of our facilities, with the announcement of funding of $9.6 million in the 2015 State budget.

What the Future Holds

This is an exciting time for Bentleigh Secondary College. We have developed an environment where leadership capacity and the voices of both staff and students are allowed to flourish. We value the strong relationships that have developed between parents, teachers, students, friends, local organisations, businesses and community groups. We are looking forward to the development and implementation of our next four-year strategic plan. We are planning for the further development and modernisation of our infrastructure. We are continually integrating new teaching and learning technologies into our learning environment. We continue to encourage a dynamic and innovative environment that allows our staff and students to shine.

Location Profile


Bentleigh High School/Secondary College was opened in 1956 and celebrated its fifty fifth year in 2011. Bentleigh Secondary College’s vision is to create a vibrant community of learners, where every students potential can be fully realised. There are currently 899 students enrolled at the college, with enrolments growing steadily at all year levels.

The college’s facilities have been transformed under the DEECD Building Futures program. The $4.3 million stage one was completed in 2006; it comprised a new double basketball stadium, a new administration and hospitality wing, and the refurbishment of the old gymnasium into a Performing Arts Centre for music, drama and dance with a theatre of 250 seats. The second stage, completed in 2008, has seen the library changed into a VCE Centre, a new learning centre with open plan spaces for four science laboratories, three multi-media spaces, a new library, and five flexible classrooms. Stage three will involve both refurbishment and new classrooms for art and technology.

Teaching and Learning at the college is based on evidence based research, with a new instructional model introduced in 2012. A revised performance and appraisal system links the Strategic Plan and AIP to student outcomes in classes and across year levels.

Bentleigh Secondary College places considerable emphasis on the outstanding quality of its teaching and gained accreditation for its Performance and Development Culture in 2005. Teachers work in teams, Areas of Learning and year levels modelling and sharing their practice, with feedback a very important part of our learning culture. The college is a leader, both nationally and internationally in Sustainability. In 2012 the college received a School Specialisation Grant funding for Sustainability Education and an International Green Award for the ‘Most Sustainable Educational Institution’.

The college is organised into two sub schools, junior (year seven to nine) and senior (year ten to twelve). Reflective practice is a driving force in our professional learning and encourages an environment with a focus on sharing data and ideas. At year nine all students spend a day on their Learning Journey developing their own projects and community involvement. Bentleigh Secondary College is proud of its academic tradition and continues to focus on literacy and numeracy across the curriculum.

New codes of behaviour have been implemented, and a learning culture that celebrates success and promotes high expectations underpins our current Strategic Plan. Staff are encouraged to use a range of data effectively to inform both curriculum and classroom plans and professional learning plans. Bentleigh Secondary College is an inclusive school and operates a significant Wellbeing program. Student support is a school focus to ensure all students are engaged in their learning and connected with their school, their peers and their teachers.

The college also has a Gifted and Talented program from year seven to nine. Students are selected for this program at the end of year six. Many of these students are in the college’s outstanding music program. The Performing Arts is a key focus of the college, with in excess of thirty public performances per year. Student voice and student feedback are increasingly important at Bentleigh Secondary College, forming an integral part of the effective use of data to promote teaching and engagement. Bentleigh Secondary College celebrates student success at its annual Presentation Night which is held at the Kingston Town Hall in December.

Selection Criteria


SC1 Demonstrated ability as Coordinator of an accredited DET International Student Program to maintain and further develop practices in line with quality standards.

SC2 Demonstrated high level written and verbal communication skills and high level interpersonal skills including a capacity to develop constructive relationships with students, parents/guardians and other staff.

Role


[Attendance requirement for this position]

Range 3 is distinguished by the introduction of management responsibility and accountability for the delivery of professional support services. The role will usually impact beyond the work area or professional field. It seeks to gain cooperation of other staff members or members of the school community to achieve specific objectives, such as in school administration, operations or educational programs.

Direction on targets and goals is provided but the position will have some degree of latitude in determining how they are achieved. This latitude will generally be limited by standard procedures and school policy.  Deviation from standard procedures and school policy will require guidance and direction from senior management.

The provision of business management responsibilities becomes a feature at range 3.  Management of staff to achieve the expected outcomes is a key responsibility.  Staff management issues will be resolved with minimal reference to senior management, although guidance will be required in more complex cases.  Senior management will be provided with timely reports and advice, although this will generally be confined to matters relating to the immediate work area, service provision or educational program and is unlikely to impact substantially on whole of school operations.

This is the minimum range for positions that carry a mandatory qualification requirement of not less than four years.  Professional student support positions become a feature at range 3 (e.g. therapists, psychologists) where standard professional services are delivered.  Professional support and guidance will be close at hand and deviation from standard procedures and school policy will require guidance and direction from senior management.

An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.  Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee¿s position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.

Responsibilities


-    Ensure the provision of a range of administrative support functions for the Principal and teaching staff. 
-    Provide administrative support to external service providers as required. 
-    Manage the processing of student admissions, registrations, enrolments and transfers. 
-    Provide required level of administrative support for school events, functions and projects. 
-    Implement induction programs for new staff, volunteers and other workers to the school.

Who May Apply


Individuals with the aptitude, experience and or/other qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of the position.

EEO AND OHS Commitment


The Department values diversity and is committed to workforce diversity and equal opportunity in schools and all education workplaces. The Department recognises that the provision of family friendly, supportive, safe and harassment free workplaces is essential to high performance and promotes flexible work, diversity and safety across all schools and Department workplaces.

Child Safe Standards


Victorian government schools are child safe environments. Our schools actively promote the safety and wellbeing of all students, and all school staff are committed to protecting students from abuse or harm in the school environment, in accordance with their legal obligations including child safe standards. All schools have a Child Safety Code of Conduct consistent with the Department’s exemplar available at http://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/programs/health/protect/Pages/childsafestandards.aspx

DET Values


The Department’s employees commit to upholding DET’s Values: Responsiveness, Integrity, Impartiality, Accountability, Respect, Leadership and Human Rights. DET’s Values complement each school’s own values and underpin the behaviours the community expects of Victorian public sector employees, including those who work in Victorian Government Schools. Information on the DET values is available at http://www.education.vic.gov.au/hrweb/workm/Pages/Public-Sector-Values.aspx

Conditions of Employment

In this study, we will develop and validate synthetic DNA tracers (both free and biopolymer-encapsulated DNA) for tracking effluent discharges in surface water, groundwater and soil. When multiple DNA tracers are concurrently used, they can provide spatially explicit information about contamination sources and pathways. The information obtained from DNA tracers could support the development of contamination mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Your role will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the synthesis of biopolymer particles and the optimisation of their physical and chemical properties</li>
<li>particle characterisation using epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, and Zetasizer</li>
<li>DNA quantification using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)</li>
<li>laboratory validation studies on the adsorption and degradation of DNA tracers</li>
<li>field validation studies in surface water, groundwater and soils.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project starts on 1 October 2016 and the PhD position is available from this date. You will be largely based at ESR's Christchurch Science Centre. You will work with a group of scientists skilled in biochemistry, molecular biology and contaminant hydrology. The development of encapsulated DNA tracers will be undertaken in collaboration with Associate Professor Elmar Prenner at the University of Calgary. ESR is a Government-owned Crown Research Institute.</p>
<p>You should have a strong background in biochemistry and molecular biology with practical skills in synthetic chemistry, and capability in the qPCR is desirable. Knowledge of contaminant hydrology would also be advantageous. Some travel to field sites is required, so you should preferably have a driving licence.</p>
<p>You will register with the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury, and your university supervisor will be Professor Jon Harding. The full scholarship includes a tax-free stipend of NZ $27,500 per year plus university fees for 3 years. To apply for the scholarship award, your grades preferably need to be A- average or better.</p>
<p>If English is not your first language, you must have passed English exams with scores that meet the requirements for postgraduate study in New Zealand, for example, an IELTS score of at least 6.5 overall, and no less than 6.0 in each band.</p>
<p><strong>Please email an expression of interest letter, your CV, your academic transcript and the names of three referees to Dr Liping Pang (liping.pang@esr.cri.nz). The position will close as soon as a suitable candidate is found so we encourage applicants to apply as early as possible.</strong></p>

As a Company they have a very low turnover of staff and are firmly at the forefront of innovation.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Initially you will be working on an interesting landmark commercial project that encompasses a large technical space. The role will be include working on a complex façade and completing finishes as part of team. Although you may lean towards working on Finishes you have to be prepared to work on set out and structure in the future but where possible they will promote your expertise on complex finishes.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">The team that you will be joining is first rate. Secondly the Company are in an enviable position where they can hand pick projects and most of the work that they do is negotiated. They have a loyal group of subcontractors; the jobs are organised, and everyone gets paid on time! As projects are very technically challenging you will always be engaged, always learning and developing your skill set. This organisation embraces cutting edge construction techniques. The environment is fast paced, but the team still have their feet firmly on the ground. Despite all their successes the culture is down to earth.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">You need to have a lot of energy and enthusiasm, be passionate about construction, have a sharp eye for detail and be motivated to focus on meeting deadlines.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">Strange as it may seem to others you love working in a fast paced environment – you like to be challenged and you enjoy accomplishing things and seeing things through to the end.

You might be an all-rounder who is a good Foreman or General Foreman, but you just have a passion for the finishing trades. Maybe you are working for a Fit out and Refurbishment Contractor and have been looking for an opportunity to cross over to a main contractor to work on new build jobs. This could be a win / win; you can shine when it comes to the finishing trades and at the same time build your working knowledge of structure and gain a more rounded knowledge base.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">As this is a long-term role you could move into a General Foreman’s role in the future.

In Brisbane, Azure is a thing. $100k - $120k depending on experience and awesomeness.","<HTML>Hidden advantages of working in the CBD include the ability to attend meetups at night. There are tons of them around, including the .NET Meetup at Microsoft, the Brisbane Functional Programming Group near Little Tokyo Two, and all the goodness that happens at River City Labs.<br> <br> So if you're a .NET developer and you're not in the CBD, this is an opportunity for you to get there.<br> <br> If you're already in the city, why might you be interested in this role? <br> <br> Well, it's very heavily Azure-focused. The cloud is now. All the WPF and Winforms stuff in the mining industry has a rapidly expiring shelf life. HTML 5 and JavaScript frameworks like Angular 2 and React are the new client platform.&nbsp;And moving applications to run in containers and virtualised environments in Azure is the next wave of that.&nbsp;<br> <br> This is a US company that does their software engineering in Australia, with a decade of experience in their domain, looking to take their current on-premise software solution (written in .NET) to the cloud as a multi-tenanted SaaS offering.<br> <br> That requires experience with Azure. Experience that you could bring, if you are one of the ten people in Brisbane with that kind of commercial experience, and one of the two of those people who are looking for a new role right now.<br> <br> I've been using Azure at night&nbsp;for a couple of weeks, now that I'm in the Microsoft Bizspark program. It's too early for me to draw a comparison - I've been developing on AWS since 2008, so a couple of weeks is not enough data to draw any conclusions.<br> <br> Anyway, hit me up at NDC Sydney for a chat if you're there.
