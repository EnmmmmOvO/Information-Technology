<h3>Aims</h3>

This exercise aims to get you to:
<ul>
<li> implement a C program to simulate a range of buffer replacement policies
</li><li> evaluate experimentally how replacement policies and buffer pool size interact
</li></ul>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Database management systems rely heavily on
the presence of numerous in-memory buffers
to avoid excessive disk reads and writes.
A point noted by Michael Stonebraker and others is
that DBMSs know better than (e.g.) the underlying operating systems,
the patterns of access to data on disk,
and should be able to manage the use of in-memory buffers very effectively.
Despite this, DBMSs still tend to rely on generic buffer replacement
strategies such as "least recently used" (LRU)
and "most recently used" (MRU).
</p>
<p>
In this exercise, we'll implement a simulator that allows us to look
at a range of buffer pool settings and policies, to determine the
best setting for dealing with one particular database operation:
nested-loop join.
</p>
<p>
The nested-loop join is a particular method for executing the
following SQL query:
</p>
<pre>select * from R join S
</pre>
<p>
It can be described algorithmically as
</p>
<pre>for each page P in R {
   for each page Q in S {
      for each tuple A in page P {
         for each tuple B in page Q {
            if (A,B) satisfies the join condition {
               append (A,B) to the Result
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
When using a buffer pool, each page is obtained via a call to the
<code>request_page()</code> function. If the page is already in the
pool, it can be used from there. If the page is not in the pool,
it will need to be read from disk, most likely replacing some
page that is currently in the pool if there are no free slots.
</p>
<p>
If no buffer pool is used (i.e. one input buffer per table),
the number of pages that will need
to be read from disk is <var>b<sub>R</sub> + b<sub>R</sub>b<sub>S</sub></var>,
where <var>b<sub>R</sub></var> and <var>b<sub>S</sub></var> are the
number of pages in tables <var>R</var> and <var>S</var> respectively.
Hopefully, accessing pages via a buffer pool will result in
considerably less page reads.
</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>
For this exercise, you won't need PostgreSQL at all.
However, there is a partly-completed version of the simulator
available in the archive
</p>
<pre><a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/pracs/p05/p05.tar">/web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p05/p05.tar</a>
</pre>
<p>
Un-<code>tar</code> this archive into a directory (folder) for this lab,
and examine the files:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">mkdir <var>/my/directory/for/p05</var></kbd>
<kbd is="shell">cd <var>/my/directory/for/p05</var></kbd>
<kbd is="shell">tar xf /web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p05/p05.tar</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">ls</kbd>
Makefile	bufpool.c	bufpool.h	joinsim.c
</pre>
<p>
The file <code>joinsim.c</code> contains the main program which
collects the simulation parameters, sets up the buffer pool,
"runs" the nested-loop query and then displays statistics on
the performance of the system.
The <code>bufpool.*</code> files implement an ADT for the buffer pool.
The <code>Makefile</code> produces an executable called <code>jsim</code>
which works as follows:
</p>
<pre><kbd is="shell">./jsim <var>OuterPages InnerPages Slots Strategy</var></kbd>
</pre>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code><var>OuterPages</var></code> is the number of pages in the
"outer" relation (<code>R</code> in the example above) </li>
<li> <code><var>InnerPages</var></code> is the number of pages in the
"inner" relation (<code>S</code> in the example above) </li>
<li> <code><var>Slots</var></code> is the number of page slots in the
buffer pool</li>
<li> <code><var>Strategy</var></code> is the buffer replacement strategy,
and can be one of
<ul>
<li> <code>L</code> ... least-recently used (page which was released earliest)
</li><li> <code>M</code> ... most-recently used (page which was last released)
</li><li> <code>C</code> ... cycling (cycles through the slots and picks the next available)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
You can compile the program as supplied, but since part of the code
is missing, you won't get sensible results. In some cases, you will
even trigger one of the <code>assert()</code> tests.
</p>
<p>
To assist with testing, there is a compiled version of my
solution available as:
</p>
<pre>/web/cs9315/24T1/pracs/p05/jsim0
</pre>
<p>
This binary was compiled on Grieg, and so that might be the
only machine where you can run it.
Doing your prac work on Grieg is probably a good idea anyway.
</p>
<p>
What you should do now is read the code in <code>bufpool.c</code>.
Start with the data structures, then look at the
<code>initBufPool()</code> function to see how the data structures
are set up.
The following diagram may help with this:
</p>
<center><img src="./P05_files/bufpool.png"></center>
<p>
The <code>nbufs</code> counter holds the total number of buffers in
the system. This is set at initialisation time and determines the
length of the three arrays.
The <code>strategy</code> field contains one character represeting
the replacement strategy (either <code>'L'</code>, <code>'M'</code> or
<code>'C'</code>).
The next four fields (<code>nrequests</code>, <code>nreleases</code>,
<code>nreads</code> and <code>nwrites</code>) are statistics counters
to monitor the buffer pool performance; they are manipulated
correctly by the supplied code.
The <code>freeList</code> is initially set to hold all of the slot
numbers, since all pages are free.
As pages are allocated, the free list becomes smaller and is
eventually empty and stays empty; at this point, all of the
slots are either in use or are in the <code>usedList</code>.
The <code>usedList</code> holds slot numbers for buffers which
have been used in the past, but which currently have a pin
count of zero.
These are the slots to be considered for removal if a new page,
Finally, <code>nfree</code> and <code>nused</code> count the number
of elements in the <code>freeList</code> and <code>usedList</code>
respectively.
</p><p>
Next, look at the <code>request_page()</code> and <code>release_page()</code>
functions
(which capture the methods pretty much as described in lectures).
Finally, look at the other functions used by <code>request_page()</code>
and <code>release_page()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
Your task for this exercise is to complete the following functions
in <code>bufpool.c</code>
</p>
<dl>
<dt> <b><code>getNextSlot(pool)</code></b> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
This function aims to find the "best" unused buffer pool slot
for a <code>request_page()</code> call.
It is called once it has been determined that (a) the requested
page is not in the buffer pool, and (b) there are no free pages
available. Thus, it needs to choose a slot from the used list;
the "best" slot is determined by the replacement strategy for the
buffer pool. If the used list is empty or if all slots have a pin
count greater than zero, then <code>getNextSlot()</code>
should return -1 (which will trigger errors higher up in the system).
If a suitable slot is found, and if the page currently occupying that
slot has been modified, the the page should be written out (note
that we don't actually write anything, simply increment the
<code>nwrites</code> counter for the buffer pool).
Finally, <code>getNextSlot()</code> should clean out the chosen buffer,
and return the index of the buffer slot to the caller.
For the <code>'C'</code> strategy, set the "next available buffer" to
the one immediately following the chosen buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <b><code>makeAvailable(pool,slot)</code></b> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
This function is called whenever the pin count on a slot reaches
zero (meaning that this slot is now available for reuse).
The function adds the slot number to the used list; where in the
list it should be added is determined by the replacement strategy.
</p>
</dd>
<dt> <b><code>removeFromUsedList(pool,slot)</code></b> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
This function will be called when a previously occupied page has
been chosen for use.
It should search for the specified slot number in the used list
and remove it from this list.
Since the method depends on how the used list is managed, it is
dependent on the replacement strategy.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Modify the above functions to achieve the specified behaviour.
If you want to change other parts of the <code>BufPool</code> ADT (e.g.
because you think my implementation is no good), feel free.
If you come up with a much better solution than mine, let me know.
</p>
<p>
Once you've implemented the functions, test that they are
behaving correctly, either by comparing the output to the
output from <code>jsim0</code> or by thinking about the expected
behaviour of the buffer pool.
</p>
<p>
Once you're satisfied that the functions are correct,
investigate the behaviour of the buffer pool under
various conditions.
Consider variations on each of the following scenarios,
where <var>N</var> is the number of buffers:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <var>N = 2</var>
</li><li> <var>b<sub>R</sub> + b<sub>S</sub> &lt; N</var>
</li><li> <var>b<sub>R</sub> + b<sub>S</sub> = N</var>
</li><li> <var>b<sub>R</sub> + b<sub>S</sub> &gt; N</var>
</li></ul>
<p>
Consider each case using each of the buffer replacement strategies.
For each scenario, try to determine what will happen and then check
your prediction by running <code>jsim</code>.
</p>

<h4>Challenge: PostgreSQL Clock-sweep Strategy</h4>
<p>
Modify the data structures to support the PostgreSQL clock-sweep buffer
replacement strategy.
Note that clock-sweep is not quite the same as the Cycle strategy used
above.
Once you've got it working, run the same set of tests that you ran for
the other strategies and compare its performance.
