Consider a SIMC-indexed database with the following properties
* all pages are B = 8192 bytes
* page descriptors have m = 4096 bits ( = 512 bytes)
* r = 102,400,   c = 100,   b = 1024
* bit-slices have b bits (128 bytes)
* false match probability p_F = 1/1000
* answer set has 1000 tuples from 100 pages
* 90% of false matches occur on data pages with true match
* 10% of false matches are distributed 1 per page
Calculate the total number of pages read in answering the query.


Number of pages of signature data:

signatures/page =
c_D = floor(B/bytes(b)) = floor(8192/128) = 64

total signature pages =
b_D = ceil(4096/c_D) = ceil(4096/64) = 64

signature pages read

read k = 10 slices, worst case = 10 pages


Number of data pages read:

true match pages = b_q = 100

false match pages =
b_F = (b-b_q) * p_F = (1024 - 100) * 0.001 = (approx) 1


Total pages read:

#pages
= signature pages + true match pages + false match pages
= 10 + 100 + 1
= 111
