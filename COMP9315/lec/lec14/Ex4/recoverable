Consider the two transactions:

T1:  W(A)  W(B)  C
T2:  W(A)  R(B)  C

Recoverable:
* all tx's Ti that wrote values used by Tj
* must have committed before Tj commits


A schedule which is recoverable and serializable

T1:  W(A)  W(B)              C
T2:              W(A)  R(B)     C


A schedule which is not recoverable but serializable

T1:  W(A)  W(B)                 C
T2:              W(A)  R(B)  C


A schedule which is recoverable but not serializable

T1:        W(A)  W(B)        C
T2:  W(A)              R(B)     C
