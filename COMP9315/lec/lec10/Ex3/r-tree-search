Describe path(s) through the tree in solving
each of the following:


Q1: select * from Rel where X='a' and Y=4

fits in a0,f7 -> fits in no subregions


Q2: select * from Rel where X='i' and Y=6

fits in f4,p9 -> fits in g4,j8 and h5,p9


Q3: select * from Rel where 'c'â‰¤Xâ‰¤'j' and Y=5

fits in a0,f7 and f4,p9 -> g4,j8 and h5,p9
                        -> b4,e7


Q4: select * from Rel where X='c'

fits in a0,f7 -> b1,f3 and b4,e7
