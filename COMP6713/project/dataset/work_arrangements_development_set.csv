Abstract: We are thrilled to offer the exciting opportunity for a knowledgeable, insightful and enthusiastic individual to join us!
Employer: Contour Education
Location: glenwaverley
Highlights: 
Contents: We are thrilled to offer the exciting opportunity for a knowledgeable, insightful and enthusiastic individual to join us as a UCAT Question Writer at Contour MedPrep.
 This isnâ€™t just any content creation role. As Australiaâ€™s fastest-growing and highest-scoring medical preparation program, our enrolments continue to triple annually, and thousands of aspiring medical students come to us for the highest tier of quality and insight. However, they are often confused by the inconsistencies and variability between currently available resources, constantly questioning what is actually realistic for their exam. This is where you come in as a vital member in our vision to reshape medical preparation. Equipped with comprehensive training, as well as your deep understanding of the skills targeted by the UCAT consortium, youâ€™ll be working alongside our team to craft questions of unparalleled accuracy and consistency to what is really tested. This involves streamlining preparation for our thousands of students so they know they are getting the best from their practice. 
 Who Are WeWe empower aspiring medical students through our comprehensive UCAT, Interview and Applications programs, supporting them throughout the highly competitive journey of gaining admission into medical school. Our UCAT course focuses on developing the specific mental abilities of a successful doctor or dentist, through engaging group lessons, abundant resources, live mock exams, 24/7 student support and so much more! We are extremely committed to innovative and results-driven medical preparation, with industry-first initiatives such as our Live UCAT Testing Centre and student accountability system propelling our students to an industry-leading median UCAT score of 3040+, dozens of 3300+ scores, and one student even setting the world record score of 3590! Over 3500+ students and 100+ staff have joined Contour since our founding in 2020. In 2024, we expanded our in-person UCAT Testing Centres from Melbourne to Brisbane and Sydney, receiving over 1000 bookings and hundreds of new enrolments from all over Australia! Our growth is a testament to our dedication to providing ALL our students and parents with a high-quality tutoring experience (from 24/7 personal support to on-demand resources) and our commitment to helping them achieve their goals. We were listed as the 17th Fastest Growing Startup by the Australian Financial Review in 2022, ranked again in 2023, and are continuing to multiply year over year! (We've tripled - or more - in size for four years in a row now, and we don't plan to slow down anytime soon.) It's our vision to reshape education, starting with tutoring.
 The Role At Contour, we understand that studying for the UCAT is riddled with confusion and complexity, with a range of often contradictory advice from different services available to students. We strive to provide the clearest path which doesnâ€™t just show shortcuts or tricks for certain questions, but instead emphasises strategies and mindsets to help students learn the real skills that are required to tackle the UCAT. But of course, we canâ€™t simply just teach such fundamental concepts, proper learning requires repeated practice with tons of high-quality, thorough, intuitive, and rigorous practice material.
 Thatâ€™s where you come in! As a UCAT Question Writer, you will be trusted with designing accurate, purposeful questions where students can effectively apply the skills that work, elevating their learning. You will also be responsible for thorough explanations that break down complex questions, making them far more approachable by effectively communicating the best strategies to apply. This role best suits someone with a creative approach to building intuitive questions, a keen eye for detail to ensure consistent quality, and a genuine passion for empowering students in their UCAT preparation journey. You will also rely on your critical thinking, and excellent communication skills to provide the most value for students, enabling them to learn something new from every question and solution they complete. With the exception of in-person training, the role is predominantly remote, offering the flexibility to balance professional and personal commitments. However, the role is still highly collaborative, meaning effective communication with other question writers, tutors and management will be instrumental in preparing the best comprehensive package for student learning. This is an opportunity to make a profound impact on the lives of aspiring medical and dental students, preparing them in the best way possible so they know they will be ready on UCAT exam day. Join us at Contour MedPrep and be a part of a dedicated team that will change the lives of thousands of future doctors and dentists!
 Why Contour, and Why This Role?Working in our collaborative environment with an energetic team is a fantastic opportunity to make an impact for thousands of students, hone your skills and learn heaps from each other along the way! At Contour MedPrep, youâ€™ll get an inside look at one of the fastest growing start-ups in education in Australia. Our team is super driven and hard-working, but weâ€™re all easy-going and friendly, and we love our frequent (paid-for ðŸ¥³) team dinners and meet-ups, where youâ€™ll get to talk and vibe with everyone. Our goal is to reshape education, starting with tutoring. By integrating technology and innovative practices, we strive to empower our studentsâ€™ learning. As we progress, our small steps start to become big strides, as we make major advances in the resources & support we provide to our students. If youâ€™re eager to channel your creative thinking and passion to guide the growth of thousands of students, this role could be the perfect fit! This isnâ€™t an ordinary admin or behind the scenes role where your critical efforts go unnoticed as you write questions alone on repeat. We recognise that resource creation isnâ€™t just about writing a tough problem, but instead crafting the best scenario to test the unique skills the UCAT requires, accompanied by a clear and comprehensive explanation which demonstrates key points for learning. Working in our team alongside other knowledgeable and dedicated question writers, youâ€™ll be able to learn from each other, review materials and demystify the UCAT for thousands of students so they can focus on learning what is actually useful. Our aim is not just to create repetitive templates with different values each time, but to shape unique questions that test core skills and create opportunities to learn. If you have a wealth of experience and deep understanding of the UCAT, this allows you to share your insights with thousands of students as they prepare for the exam that makes or breaks their dream course. As Contour MedPrep rapidly expands, youâ€™ll also see opportunities for career growth, including greater responsibility and even leading future teams!
 Comprehensive Training & SupportWhen you join, you'll be properly onboarded with all the training, support and personal feedback you need to thrive in the role. Youâ€™ll work closely with our leadership team and UCAT Resources Team Leader to upskill and refine your communication and critical thinking, and youâ€™ll be thoroughly introduced to all of our software, processes resource structures. By the end of your initial training, the role will become second-nature to you and youâ€™ll know our processes for top tier question creation inside-out. Youâ€™ll feel confident utilising our guides to construct the best possible resources for students, and even evaluating and learning from the materials created by other question writers. After the initial training, youâ€™ll also have regular 1-on-1 check-ins with the UCAT Resources Team Leader and ongoing group training to help accelerate your personal and professional development within the role. There will also be regular team meetings and social catch-ups to keep everyone on the same page and to help you build long-lasting, genuine relationships with the rest of our amazing team!
 Key ResponsibilitiesAs one of our UCAT Question and Solution Writers, your main responsibilities include:  Question Writing: Creating unique questions which enable students to develop skills critical to success in the UCAT through repeated application. With practice questions as the backbone of the learning process, your work will be essential in guiding students and enabling them to learn from materials you provide which accurately target the difficulty, style and required techniques of the UCAT.. Solutions Creation: Creating comprehensive explanations that donâ€™t just explain how to get to the best answer, but also outline key strategies that work best to tackle each unique question, helping students save time and improve their accuracy as they learn from each question they complete. . Proofreading: Validating and providing feedback on questions or solutions written by other team members, ensuring the highest standard of quality. This involves checking both checking for errors within questions, but also making improvements to finer details such as subtle differences in the praising of answer options and questions whenever possible.

Training and Meetings: Complete our comprehensive initial onboarding and training program as you get started in the role.
