Consider the following transaction <i>T1</i>: <tt>R(X), R(X)</tt>
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
Give an example of another transaction <i>T2</i> that, if run concurrently
to transaction <i>T1</i> without some form of concurrency control, could
interfere with <i>T1</i> to produce unrepeatable reads. Show the sequence
of operations which would cause the problem.
</p>

<div id="q1" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
Even a transaction as simple as <i>T2</i>: <tt>W(X)</tt> is sufficient to
cause unrepeatable reads. If <i>T2</i> runs concurrently with <i>T1</i>
and if the <tt>W(X)</tt> operation occurs between the two <tt>R(X)</tt>
operations, then <i>T1</i> sees a different value of <tt>X</tt> on each
of the read operations. The following schedule shows the problem:
</p>
<pre>T1:  R(X)        R(X)
T2:        W(X)

Explain how the application of strict two-phase locking would prevent the
problem described in your previous answer.

<div id="q2" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
In the case of two-phase locking the transactions would be re-written as:
</p>
<pre>T1: ReadLock(X)  R(X)  R(X)  Unlock(X)

T2: WriteLock(X)  W(X)  Unlock(X)
</pre>
<p>
If <i>T1</i> starts first and acquires the ReadLock on <tt>X</tt>, then <i>T2</i>
will be unable to proceed until <i>T1</i> has completed its two reads (it
cannot acquire the WriteLock while another transaction holds a ReadLock).
If <i>T2</i> starts first and acquires the WriteLock on <tt>X</tt>, then
<i>T1</i> will be unable to proceed until <i>T2</i> has completed (it
cannot acquire a ReadLock while another transaction holds a WriteLock).
</p>
<p>
The following two schedules are the only possible ones that can occur
(where "<tt>.....</tt>" indicates a delay while waiting for a lock):
</p>
<pre>Schedule 1:

T1:  ReadLock(X)  R(X)  R(X)  Unlock(X)
T2:             .......................  WriteLock(X)  W(X)  Unlock(X)

Schedule 2:

T1:             .................  ReadLock(X)  R(X)  R(X)  Unlock(X)
T2: WriteLock(X)  W(X)  Unlock(X)

SQL supports four isolation-levels and two access-modes, for a total of
eight combinations of isolation-level and access-mode. Each combination
implicitly defines a class of transactions; the following questions
refer to these eight classes: 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
Describe which of the following phenomena can occur at each of the
four SQL isolation levels: dirty read, unrepeatable read, phantom problem.

<div id="q3" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
For Read Uncommitted, all three may occur.<br>
For Read Committed, only unrepeatable read and the phantom problem may occur.<br>
For Repeatable Read, only the phantom problem may occur.<br>
For Serializable, none of the problems can occur.
</p></div><p></p>
</li><li>
<p>
Why does the access mode of a transaction matter?
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q4a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex09/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q4&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q4" style="color:#000099;display:none">
If all transactions are READ-ONLY mode, then the isolation level
doesn't matter, since none of the problems noted above can occur.
As soon as even one transaction is READ/WRITE access mode, then
the above problems <em>may</em> occur, and an appropriate
isolation-level needs to be used to avoid any of the above
problems that are undesirable.

Draw the precedence graph for the following schedule:

T2:                R(Y)           R(Y)

The precedence graph has an edge, from <i>T1</i> to <i>T3</i>,

It also has an edge, from <i>T2</i> to <i>T3</i>,

It also has an edge, from <i>T3</i> to <i>T2</i>,

Is the following schedule conflict serializable? Show your working.

<p>
As above, the working for this question involves constructing a
precedence graph, based on conflicting operations, and looking
for cycles.
</p>
<p>
In this case there's a conflict between <tt>T1:R(X)</tt> and
<tt>T2:W(X)</tt>, giving a graph edge from <tt>T1</tt> to <tt>T2</tt>.
There's also a conflict between <tt>T2:R(Y)</tt> and <tt>T1:W(Y)</tt>,
giving a graph edge from <tt>T2</tt> to <tt>T1</tt>.
This means the graph has a cycle, so the schedule is not serializable.

Recoverability and serializability are both important properties of
concurrent transaction schedules. They are also orthogonal.
Serializability requires that the schedule be equivalent to some serial
ordering of the transactions.
Recoverability requires that each transaction commits only after all
of the transactions from which is has read data have also committed.
</p>
<p>
Using the following two transactions: 
</p>
<pre>T1:  W(A)  W(B)  C         T2:  W(A)  R(B)  C
</pre>
<p>
give examples of schedules that are:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> recoverable and serializable
</li><li> recoverable and not serializable
</li><li> not recoverable and serializable
</li></ol>
<p><small>[<a id="q10a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex09/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q10&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q10" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<ol type="a">
<li> <p>the following schedule is both recoverable and serializable</p>
<pre>T1:  W(A)  W(B)              C
T2:              W(A)  R(B)     C
</pre>
<p>
The update operations of the schedules are serial, and therefore serializable.
For recoverability, the only read is <tt>R(B)</tt> in T2, and T2 does not
commit until after T1 has committed.
</p>
</li><li> <p>the following schedule is recoverable but not serializable</p>
<pre>T1:        W(A)  W(B)       C
T2:  W(A)             R(B)     C
</pre>
<p>
There is a cycle in the dependency graph T2--A-&gt;T1 and T1--B-&gt;T2,
so it's not serializable. However, T1 commits before T2, so it's
recoverable for the same reasons as (a).
</p>
</li><li> <p>the following schedule is not recoverable but is serializable</p>
<pre>T1:  W(A)  W(B)                 C
T2:              W(A)  R(B)  C
</pre>
<p>
It is clearly serializable for the same reason as (a).
However, since T2 commits before T1 we could end up in the following
scenario: T2 commits completely but the system crashes before T1 does.
After recovery, T2 would remain committed, but T1 would be rolled back
because it has no log entry. Since the result of T2 depends on T1's
completion, we would have a contradiction; T2 should not be able to
complete if T1 does not complete.

ACR schedules avoid the potential cascading rollbacks that can make
recoverable schedules less than desirable.

The following schedule is clearly serializable.

The basic idea behind two-phase locking is that you take out all the locks
you need, do the processing, and then release the locks. Thus two-phase
implementations of <tt>T1</tt> and <tt>T2</tt> would be:
</p>
<pre>     T1               T2

Is there a non-serial schedule for <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> that is

<div id="q13" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
No. It's not possible. The last operation in <i>T1</i> is <tt>write(B)</tt>,
and the last operation in <i>T2</i> is <tt>write(A)</tt>. <i>T1</i>
starts with <tt>read(A)</tt> and <i>T2</i> starts with <tt>read(B)</tt>.
Therefore, in any serializable schedule, we would require that either
<tt>read(A)</tt> in <i>T1</i> should  be after <tt>write(B)</tt> in
<i>T2</i> or <tt>read(B)</tt> in <i>T2</i> should be after

What is the difference between quiescent and non-quiescent checkpointing?
Why is quiescent checkpointing not used in practice?
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q15a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex09/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q15&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q15" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
In quiescent checkpointing, the system must wait until there are no
active transactions, then flush the transaction log and write a
checkpoint record. All transactions before the checkpoint are complete,
and do not need to be considered further in any subsequent recovery.
</p>
<p>
In non-quiescent checkpointing, the system marks a checkpoint period
via a pair of start-checkpoint and end-checkpoint records.
The checkpoint covers a period in time during which active transactions
may have made changes to the database. Recovery to checkpoints
is more complicated, and must take account of which transactions were
active before and after the checkpoint started, and which ones
completed during the checkpoint period.
</p>
<p>
Because real database systems are heavily used and must have high
availability. The first point (heavy use) means that there is never
have any point in time when there are no transactions executing.
The second point (high availability) means that we can't afford to
block all new transactions while the system runs checkpointing.

Consider the following sequence of undo/redo log records:
</p>
<pre>&lt;START T&gt; ; &lt;T,A,10,11&gt; ; &lt;T,B,20,21&gt; ; &lt;COMMIT T&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Give all of the sequences of <q>events</q> that are legal according to the
rules of undo/redo logging.
An <q>event</q> consists of one of: writing to disk a block containing a
given data item, and writing to disk an individual log record.
</p>
<p><small>[<a id="q16a" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/24T1/exercises/ex09/index.php##" onclick="toggleVisible(&#39;q16&#39;)">show answer</a>]</small></p>
<div id="q16" style="color:#000099;display:none">
<p>
In this example, there are five events, which we shall denote:

<ul>
<li> A: database element A is written to disk.

</li><li> LA: the log record for A is written to disk.
</li><li> LB: the log record for B is written to disk.
</li><li> C: the commit record is written to disk.
</li></ul>
<p>
The only constraints that undo/redo logging requires are that LA
appears before A, and LB appears before B. Of course the log records
must be written to disk in the order in which they appear in the log:
LA,LB,C.
The eight orders consistent with these constraints are:

Describe the actions of the recovery manager, if there is a crash and the
last log record to appear on disk is:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li> <p> <tt>&lt;START U&gt;</tt> </p>
</li><li> <p> <tt>&lt;COMMIT U&gt;</tt> </p>
</li><li> <p> <tt>&lt;T,E,50,51&gt;</tt> </p>
</li><li> <p> <tt>&lt;COMMIT T&gt;</tt> </p>
</li></ol>
<p>
You may assume that there is an <tt>&lt;END CKPT&gt;</tt> record in the
log immediately before the start of transaction T, so that we do not need
to worry about the log any further back than the start of T.

Each recovery session these commences with a scan forward from the most recent
checkpoint (just before start of T), to determine which transactions
had started and which had committed since the checkpoint.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
Since neither T nor U is committed, we need to undo all of their actions.
We move backwards through the log to the most recent checkpoint. Since U
had only just started, we find no actions by it to undo. However, we do
find an update record for T, so we reset the value of A to 10.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Since U is committed, we redo its actions, setting B to 21 and D to 41.
Then, since T is uncommitted, we undo its actions from the end moving
backwards; we reset C to 30 and A to 10.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
This is similar to the previous part, except that we also reset E to 50.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
In this case, both transactions have finished, and so we need to redo all
of their actions, setting A to 11, B to 21, C to 31, D to 41 and E to 51.
There are no incomplete transactions, so there is no need for an undo
pass.
