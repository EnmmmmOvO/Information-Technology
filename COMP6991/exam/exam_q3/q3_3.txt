1. Rust's type system is both static and strongly typed, requiring that the type of each variable be determined at compile time and remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program. When `cond` is true, it returns an `i32`, and when false, it returns a `&str`. This means the entire if expression attempts to return two different types based on the condition. As a result, the Rust compiler cannot determine whether the specific type of the `item` variable should be `i32` or `bool`, leading to a compilation error.

2. If the condition must support two possible types, a better choice would be to use an enum. By implementing the `Display` trait for this enum, the return type becomes an enum type, allowing the program to operate correctly. This approach provides a structured way to handle multiple types within a single variable, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of the code.

   ```rust
   enum Result {
       Int(i32),
       Text(&'static str),
   }
   
   impl Display for Result {
       fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
           match self {
               Result::Int(i) => write!(f, "{}", i),
               Result::Text(s) => write!(f, "{}", s),
           }
       }
   }
   
   fn print_something(cond: bool) {
       let item = if cond {
           Result::Int(42)
       } else {
           Result::Text("foo")
       };
   
       print_in_stars(item);
   }
   ```

   Alternatively, we could also convert the value `42` to "42", it also can solve the issues.

   ```rust
   fn print_something(cond: bool) {
       let item = if cond {
           "42"
       } else {
           "foo"
       };
   
       print_in_stars(item);
   }
   ```
