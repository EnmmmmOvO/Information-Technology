1. In this program, x is set as a reference to y within the scope of the block. However, since y's lifetime ends once the block concludes, y is destroyed. Consequently, in the println part, x refers to data that no longer exists, which results in an error. This demonstrates Rust's safety features that prevent dangling references by ensuring that references do not outlive the data they are pointing to.

2. No, this actually showcases Rust's advantages. In C, a resource that has been freed can still be accessed through a previously recorded pointer, which can lead to errors. We would need to check if the pointer is null to determine if the data is still valid. Rust uses lifetime specifications to constrain all references, preventing dangling references by ensuring that references do not outlive the data they point to. This ensures all data validity during the static compilation stage, something C cannot achieve.
